[1] THE AVATAR EXERCISES

(A Starvation Diet for the Intellect)


    The AVATAR Exercises are a series of disciplines that are
known to have a very profound effect upon the development of
consciousness. We provide sufficient data to enable you to gain
familiarity with the exercise. As you practice the exercise, you
will quickly discover that what we have said about the exercises
is minuscule in comparison to what we have left unsaid. This is
a purposeful omission on our part to invite you to do your own
exploring.

    The exercises activate subtle shifts in awareness that tend
to cause changes in a person's state of invigoration, well-being
and/or creative power. These changes in condition are reliable
indicators that you are progressing toward an experiential
clarity of the exercise rather than merely gaining an
intellectual understanding.

    The exercises are capable of producing the kind of
revelations that leave one on one's knees, in reverence, sobbing
tears of joy. Enjoy them. Indulge yourself.

[2] FEEL IT

An edited transcription of a lecture
given on April 17, 1987 by Harry Palmer.




How do you feel?

(Audience: Great!)

I'm going to ask you to do something really selfish tonight, OK?

Will you be selfish for awhile?

I'm going to ask you to _feel_. A very selfish thing! I mean, if
you think about it, you never feel for the greater good of
mankind. _Feel_ is a very egotistical, selfish thing to do.
Which may be why a lot of people are starting to turn it off.
They don't _feel_ very much. So I'm going to have you _feel_.

Do you want a definition of feel? "To touch or handle in order
to become aware of. Examine or test by touching or handling."

OK, touch something, handle something, become aware of it.

(Pause)

Maybe it's because we've grown up in a society that values
intellect very highly, that there's this little automatic
translation device we've installed that works like this: we
touch something, and when we touch it, we say "smooth." "Smooth"
is a sound that intellectually symbolizes a certain feel; _it's
not the feel_. Sometimes we touch something and as soon as we
can translate it into a word we go "Oh, that's smooth-felt
it-smooth, what do you want me to translate next?"

(Laughter)

So feel, don't translate.

(Pause)

Boy, do you see how selfish we can get? No translation at all.

(Reading from dictionary) "To perceive or be aware of through
physical sensation."

Give me some examples of _physical sensations_.

Audience calls off: "Heat. Light. Pressure. Hunger. Sexy. Pain.
Thirst. Sound. Smell. Touch. Dizzy."

Very good. _Feel_, be aware of the reflected light striking your
retinas.

(Pause)

(From dictionary) "To experience an emotion or condition, such
as to feel joy, to feel pain."

Feel joy without labelling it. Don't focus on _saying_ how you
feel, focus on _feeling_ how you feel.

We get into putting words on things to such an extreme that
feeling something becomes secondary to the urge to communicate
it. It's like going on a vacation and the important part is
coming back and telling someone, or showing them the pictures.

And of course when you get into the idea of living for others,
you also get into the idea that others should live for you,
which begins to make them responsible for how you feel.

It's better to be selfish and live for yourself, which allows
others to live for themselves, too. Learn to feel what you feel,
even create what you want to feel, and don't be too concerned
about substituting words for what you're experiencing.
Describing it just interrupts the flow.

Oh, you want to share? Here's a curious phenomena, if you take
two people, or even more, and you sit them down together in a
place, and don't let them talk, after a period of time they will
feel the same way! Emotional inductance. Resonance. Natural
Empathy. Sharing. How would you describe it?

Now, if they talk, they probably won't end up feeling the same
because the words they translate their feelings into don't mean
the same to both of them. For example, she says "I hate you" to
describe the feeling of being hurt. He translates the words "I
hate you" into the feeling of being angry. Oh, what a mess!

But see, without words there's a match of vibrations; just from
having them close to each other, in the same space, the
vibrations will eventually coincide, and they'll feel the same,
empathy will develop and the upset will disappear. Having people
meet face to face to talk out their upsets works because of the
harmonizing of their vibrations from their physical closeness.
What they say is of secondary importance. In fact, talking may
at times slow down the process. Have you ever made up with
someone just because you were tired of arguing?

So what's the lesson here? Do we stop talking? I don't think so.

What we need to recognize is that words are symbols (not the
real thing) that allow us to achieve an intellectual
understanding (also not the real thing). Words are not
particularly effective for communicating experiential clarity.
On the other hand, feelings allow us to telepathically
communicate an experience, but are not particularly effective
for communicating intellectual understanding.

Both understanding and experience have their places. The
difficulty arises when we confuse them. You can't satisfy hunger
by understanding that if you had some food you wouldn't feel
that way.

When you're _not_ translating into words and you just hang out
with somebody for a little while, you'll soon be on their
wavelength. You'll feel the way they feel. This may explain the
high that one experiences from hanging out with holy men. It's
not just their words.

Somebody who looks like this (slumps body to look sad) can't say
"Aw, I'm feeling great." You are receiving conflicting data.
Unless you turn off the vibrations completely and rely solely on
the intellect, the person will leave you just a bit uneasy. You
stop and ask "Are you sure?"

"Oh yeah, I'm feeling great."

You stop him because the experience isn't right. The experience
is on a telepathic, resonance level. It doesn't agree with your
translation of what the words "I'm feeling great" feels like. So
is the fellow lying to you? Maybe, maybe not. He may translate
this feeling (slumps) into the words "feeling great." Maybe
that's what "feeling great" means to him. Do you follow me?

(Yes)

So I'm going to have you experiment with something. Breathe for
a minute. You know how you breathe, you go (breathes) suck in
air to your chest, let air out, like that. OK, now this one is
risky. Instead of moving your chest, push your stomach out, and
bring your stomach in, push your stomach out, bring your stomach
in. As you're doing that your lungs will automatically fill with
air. And when your chest stops, it appears that you've stopped
breathing.

It's a little scary, at first.

The thing I'm showing you is that when you're feeling,
experiencing, the breathing tends to be lower. It's visceral,
it's feeling. And the more into symbols and intellectual
understanding that a person goes, the higher this breathing
moves up. Up tight, eh. I suspect that mild oxygen deprivation
increases mental activity.

Here's a trick for switching from intellectual understanding to
experience. A reverse translation. Breathe low with the stomach
while repeating the idea you wish to translate into feelings. Do
this for awhile and the idea will change to a feeling.

"I feel good." Deep breath. "I feel good." Deep breath. "I feel
good." Deep breath. "I feel good." Deep breath. And if the
feeling you get doesn't fit your intellectual understanding of
that experience, who are you going to believe?

When you're experiencing something that has some intellectual
judgment about how bad or unpleasant it is, ease into the feel
of it by breathing with your stomach and feel it a little more
with each breath. Breathe through the experience and the
judgment will disappear.

I want you to find something you consider beautiful in this
room, and then experience your perception of beauty. This is
totally on a selfish flow; you're never going to translate this
feeling.

(Pause)

Oh great, it feels so great in here! Can you feel that?

(Yes!)

Did you get that feeling without any particular urge to
interpret it or translate it into words?

OK, feel a person without any need or urge to translate it into
words.

(Pause)

Oh, do it with your hands! Co-create an agreement!

Now, did you actually feel the flesh, and bones, or did you feel
a person and a little embarrassment?

Feel the person again and feel the meat. Different, huh? Are you
starting to regain some experiential clarity?

OK, here is a great truth. _Things become complicated to the
degree that symbols are substituted for feelings_.

So relax, enjoy, life is a process, an experience. It continues.

Here's another thing to feel. Feel alive without any
interpretation or need to translate it. Now feel very alive.

(Pause)

Does anybody think that he's doing this wrong? That's a joke.

(Laughter)

Now when you just live life and you feel what's going on, it
flows. When you resist it, you start to translate it and put
symbols on it, you shift into an intellectual appreciation of
life. Take a deep breath, relax, let it flow.

In philosophy, words are symbols for life. A reflection of life.
They're a representation of life. Now the interesting thing is
that symbols require explanation, _life doesn't_. A great
scholar may know all of the teachings of all of the masters; he
can say the right word at the right time; every question that
you'd ever ask he has an answer. But he doesn't _feel life_; he
lacks experiential clarity; he's not really an enlightened man;
he's just a very knowledgeable man, an intellectual.

He's got all the explanations, and he's going around saying
"Well, it means this, and it means that." _But, only symbols
mean, life is experience_.

Feel alive!

(Pause)

You did that very well. When I asked you to find something
beautiful and experience it, it was pretty easy to do, but
actually it was an interpretation that you placed on something.
Oh, that's beautiful, that's ugly. That's wonderful, that's un-
wonderful-that's wonderless. So it wasn't the thing that caused
you to experience beauty, was it?

It's the intellectual interpretations that we place on our
environment that cause us to experience it as beautiful or ugly.
The same applies to experiencing feelings: it's the intellectual
interpretation we place on them that makes them pleasant or
unpleasant. Feelings are feelings, experience. When you come up
and say "Pain-ugh." "Wow! Electrical impulse . . . hot, cold . .
. pressure. Wow!" And "Hey, and blood," and you go "Oh! That's
very bad!"

Well, it just is. It's part of existence. It's part of life.
It's not a good or a bad feeling. But when you put an
interpretation on it, "Oh, that's a very bad thing," and then
when you're presented with it, why you resist it. But what are
you resisting? Just your own judgments. The interpretation that
you've put on it. It's bad, ooh, stay away from it. You set up a
little ridge, or you set up one of these (pushes fists
together). On one side of it is your interpretation of the
feeling; on the other side is the resist that you have on
experiencing the feeling. You wouldn't have resisted it if you
hadn't interpreted it as something that you shouldn't
experience. That's how you lock yourself up-something is
presented for your experience and you put a judgment on it:

"Oh boy, that's very bad, don't experience that!"

Do you know what the purpose is for any action? To feel
something or to avoid feeling something!

The purpose behind any action is to feel something, or to avoid
feeling something. When a being is motivated by an avoidance to
feeling something, he acts out of fear. Fear will eventually
move one into this intellectual level, where symbols have been
substituted for feelings. Feelings are no longer safe.

People who have the purpose to _feel create_; people who have
the purpose to avoid feeling _think_.

The most creative people not only feel, but they can translate
feelings into symbols that will arouse feelings in another. The
one who is avoiding feeling, often imagines the creative person
is enforcing feeling on him, and he usually counters with some
act of resistance. This causes suffering.

Every great movement, every society, every evolutionary phase
has always started with a rediscovery of feelings; they always
start at a time when people have lost touch with feelings and
are living on an intellectual level. And someone comes along,
some sort of messiah, or a pretty bright being who's had an
experience of enlightenment, and he coaxes the people back into
feeling. You see, he moves them beyond symbols and back into
feeling; and they experience that he makes them feel very alive.
The movement makes them feel alive, or experiencing care or
building for the future makes them feel alive, because they're
moving out of this level where they resisted experiencing and
where life had become symbols.

So any movement that has power actually moves people from
dealing with symbols and thinking back into feeling, to feeling
alive. It's the excitement; you feel excitement; you come alive.

Later on, when the movement has lost some of its vigor, it can
be successfully resisted by those who fear change, who are
avoiding feeling; and one by one disaffected followers shift
back into an intellectual mode and _try to understand_ how they
could have acted so irrationally. Their usual solution is to
blame it all on the charismatic leader, whose spell they must
have fallen under.

Assassination, crucifixion, and genocide are motivated by fear.
They are intellectual solutions.

So what is the meaning of life? Life is. It doesn't come with a
meaning. You can study the symbols or you can go out and feel
alive.

The ancient Vedas were the essence, the feel of life. Their
purpose was to transmit from one being to another being what
life feels like.

Feel life; life is.

Sometimes you have to transmit the feel of life with symbols;
that's the liability of not being able to hang out with somebody
on a mountain top, not being able to look into their eyes and
silently hug them. So we use symbols. But in time the symbols
tend to acquire _meaning_, and then they no longer represent
feelings or experiences, but they begin to represent other
symbols. The meanings acquire a false importance and the essence
is lost. So books about books are written. And the true Vedas
begin to be reinterpreted and reinterpreted and reinterpreted,
until they become intellectual exercises.

It was said of the Vedas that they were the breath of the
eternal. That there was never a time when there were not Vedas;
that they actually preceded the appearance of man.

And the word "veda" means "the feel of life." That's my
translation. So the Vedas are more than symbols.

Some scholars say "Oh yeah, the Sanskrit stuff, ancient, here
are the Vedas," but the Vedas are actually any teaching that
brings a person to feel alive, you know? Something that cuts
through the level of symbols and wakes someone up.

So what does it all mean?

(Laughter)

Well, with the Avatar preparatory exercises, people are starting
to wake up. The first thing that happens is you recover a level
of source, if you wish to call it that, where the _meaning is
what you assign, rather than what you find_. For the seeker,
this is the end of the line.

(Laughter, comments from the audience)

(Audience: What is intuition?)

Intuition is sensing the feeling behind the symbols. It's going
by what you're experiencing rather than by an understanding of
the symbols. Our intuition allows us to translate an
understanding of scriptures into an experience of enlightenment.

Did I tell you the story about the dolphins, how the dolphins
perceive? No? OK, dolphins send out a sound wave and it bounces
off of things, and they continue to send out a sound wave, and
the sound wave going out bounces back and it hits the sound wave
they are continuing to send out, which creates beats as the two
sounds interfere with each other. From the interference pattern
of the two sounds, the dolphins get another sound which they
interpret into a three-dimensional picture of their world. "A
sunken ship over there, a lot of gold treasure over there."
(Laughter) "A large fish over here."

Well, the neat thing about a dolphin is he can swim around an
island and approach another dolphin; then, instead of sending
out the sonar sound, he sends out the interference pattern of
what he saw. The second dolphin hearing it, sees images just as
if he were there where the first dolphin had been.

He perceives the same three-dimensional picture. A treasure,
ship, fish, the same excitement. Just as if he were there. This
type of communication is a little bit senior to the
communication of symbols and words that we use. In fact, when we
look at the dolphins' form of communication, we see that our
efforts are really inefficient. The only way we can even
approach a dolphin's effectiveness is to have picture
dictionaries, and keep everyone agreeing on what picture the
words represent.

(Audience: If you could telepathically communicate the feeling
of the experience, that would be much closer to it.)

Yes. And you know, I think we do that all of the time. That's
continually going on. It's just there. Ready to be tuned into,
and you tune into it by feeling. It gets invalidated when we
attempt to translate it into intellectual symbols, but what we
feel is what we feel.

How are you all feeling?

(Audience: Great!)

(Brad: Would you read that one phrase about truth over again?)

Sure. _Things become complicated to the degree symbols are
substituted for feelings_.

(Brad: What does that mean?)

(Laughter, comments from the audience)

(Steve: What happens is that when you get to thinking as opposed
to feeling, you really remove yourself from the thing. When
you're feeling, as opposed to thinking, you actually become the
thing you feel. In the action of thinking you're actually
separate from it. I think that's the big difference. Instead of
being part of it, you part from it.)

Yes, that feels right!

(Laughter)

Thinking is produced by resisting the experience of something.

(Sue: What kind of waves are we talking about? It really strikes
truth when you say we're always communicating feelings with
brain waves, or some kind of waves?)

Well, you know how you go into a room where someone's just had a
fight and been real upset and you'll find that you're actually
having to make an effort not to be upset? You shift into an
intellectual mode. In other words, you're resisting experiencing
the upsetness too, intellectualizing that if at least one of you
is calm, it'll be better? That may or may not be true, but
you'll find that you start to intellectualize when you resist
the feeling in the room. Maybe you say to yourself, "I'm not
going to let them upset me."

And from another strata of consciousness it was, "Hey, listen,
I'll tell you what. You say this, and then I'll get upset, and
that'll be kinda neat, you know?"

(Laughter)

Of course, if you'd experience it, you could change it.

OK guys, you really feel good, but I'm going to end now.

----------------------------------------------------------------





[3] FEEL IT EXERCISES

THEORY


The only constant in the universe is _change_.

As persons, places, events, conditions, viewpoints and ideas are
_permitted_ to proceed of their own accord, they will undergo
change.

_Everything flows!_ Experiencing the flow may permit a person to
direct it or to exist in harmony with it. One welcomes and
experiences the change, recognizing new opportunities; or one
struggles and resists the change, thus experiencing suffering,
for everything changes.

One may choose his own attitude toward change, but meet change
he will. Everything flows.

_Choosing_ to resist the experience of something which one hay
chosen to experience (by his or her creation of beliefs) creates
the effect of suffering, of being swept along, of being out of
control. One creates against oneself. Feeling is replaced by
thinking.

But when one changes his attitude, and experiences what he has
chosen to experience (acknowledging oneself as source of the
beliefs that attracted the experience), he may then create new
beliefs as to what experience he will attract next.

_Those persons, places, events, conditions, viewpoints and ideas
which one resists experiencing will continue to be created with
slight variation until they are experienced as being in accord
with the beliefs held by the particular stratum of consciousness
that is creating them._

All upsets in relationships are caused by refusing to experience
something.

Experiencing something consists of identifying with and feeling
what it feels. It is exciting! It is expansive! It fulfills the
primal purpose of existence.

PRACTICAL


The following exercises may be done with or without supervision.
They should be done in a variety of spaces, including
out-of-doors. Adopt a gradient approach. Start small and work
up. A brief summary should be written up after one has achieved
a satisfactory result on each exercise.

Note: You are actually working on recognizing and developing a
perceptive skill that will allow you to experience your
creations. If you have any doubt that such a skill exists,
notice your ease of identification and experience of the body.
Supplement the exercise with whatever degree of imagination you
need to get a perception.




Step 1: Inanimate objects, locations and spaces.


Select some object, location or space that interests you.
Observe it carefully for a few seconds.

_Define_ the object by observing its periphery, edges or limits.
Identify with it and feel what it feels.

For example, if you are identifying with a stone, feel its
weight bearing down on the earth as your weight, feel its
exposed surfaces as your surfaces, feel its density as your
density. Transform the stone into you the stone. Be the stone.
(Experiment with using the stomach breathing technique described
in the "Feel It" transcript.)

Suggestions of things to experience: houses, cars, what a road
feels like, bodies of water, mountains, etc.

When you have achieved a satisfactory result, write up a brief
summary of your experience.




Step 2. Animate objects


Select an animate object, animal, plant or person, that
interests you. Observe it for a few seconds.

Define its edges, notice the actual space it occupies. Identify
with it and feel what it feels.

Example: If you choose to identify with a tree, feel its limbs
as your limbs, feel the breeze against its leaves as the breeze
against your leaves, feel the roots as your roots. Be the tree.

When you have achieved a satisfactory result, write up a brief
summary of your experience.




Step 3. Beliefs (Supervised session)


Select a belief that interests you. Put your attention on it for
a few seconds. Define its edges and notice the space it occupies
in whatever dimension in which it exists.

Identify with the belief and feel what it feels like to hold
that belief.

Example: If you choose to identify with a belief that you are
happy, feel what it feels like to be happy, feel joy. Be happy.

Summarize your experiences with the exercise.

[4] LABEL IT EXERCISES

This exercise may be done with or without supervision. It should
be done in a variety of spaces, including out-of-doors. Adopt a
gradient approach. Start small and work up. A brief summary of
your experience should be written up after one has achieved a
satisfactory result with each exercise.



PURPOSE

The purpose of this exercise is to allow you to investigate and
explore what effect your opinion has, if any, on your ability to
perceive or experience objects, bodies, feelings and ideas.




Step 1: Labeling Spaces With Opinions


Define (determine the limits, circumference of) the space
occupied by an object

_Create_ an opinion of the object (good, bad, ugly, beautiful,
etc.).

Identify with the object and feel what it feels.

Change you opinion of the object and again identify with it and
feel what it feels. Repeat to satisfactory result.

Write up a brief summary of your experience.




Step 2: Labeling Other People With Opinions


Define the space occupied by another person.

Once you have defined the space occupied by a person, create an
opinion of that person.

Identify with the person and feel what they feel.

Change your opinion of the person and again feel what they
feel. Repeat to satisfactory result

Write up a brief summary of your experience.

or any other material, bearing a
name, title, address, or the like,
affixed to something to indicate
its nature, contents, ownership,
destination, or other particulars.

Label: (verb) to affix, mark or
attach with a label.

Define: (verb) to determine,

Opinion: a belief that seems
true, valid or probable to one's
own mind; a judgment
----------------------------------




Step 3: Labeling Beliefs With Opinions


Create and define a belief.

Once you have defined the belief, create an opinion of that
belief.

Identify with the belief and feel what it feels to have that
belief.

Change your opinion of the belief and again feel what it feels
like to have that belief. Repeat until you achieve a
satisfactory result.

Write up as above.




Step 4: Labeling Just As It Is


Define something. (Person, object, feeling and idea.)

Once you have defined the person, object, feeling or idea,
identify with it and feel what it feels.

Label the thing just as it is. (Without translating your
perceptions or adding opinions.)

Write up a brief summary of your experience.




Step 5: Surrendering All Judgment


Locate a comfortable, safe location. Select something or
someone. Be aware of it (or them) but choose to create no
response to it (or them). Do this until you can easily recognize
the difference between the things, events or people that tend to
indue you to create a response, and those things, events or
people that induce no response. Continue the exercise until you
have surrendered all judgment. Include any realizations you may
have had in your summary.

Definitions:

Judgment; a criticism or
censure; an opinion.

Response: something said or
done in answer, a reply or
reaction.

No: not in any degree; not at
all.

[5] CREATION EXERCISES

(Revised and reissued by Star's Edge International 3/15/92
to update and replace "Creations Exercises" in current Avatar
Course Section II)




Foundational Beliefs


Awareness and consciousness are not the same.

Awareness is without form, limit or restriction. It is a
potential that neither lacks nor contains. Awareness _of
something within a span of time_ is consciousness. Awareness is
the primal source of all creation, including consciousness.
Awareness without form, limit or restriction is the beginning,
the continuing, and the transforming of all things. It is the
source of the idea that there is a unity of which all things are
a part.

Life is consciousness.

In truth one is, at some level, always source, but at other
levels one may create against one's self until that level of
self appears as a no-source.

The creation of one's life is the result of a primary intention
originated by awareness and contained in/sustained as
consciousness. The fundamental intention is, "an I exists."



-----------------------------------------
Definitions:

Spontaneous: 1. acting in accordance
with or resulting from a natural feeling,
impulse, or tendency, without any
contraint, effort, or premeditation.
2. having no apparent external cause or
influence; occuring or produced by its
own energy, force, etc. or through
internal causes; self acting.

Primary Origination: a creation or
communication invested with sufficient
intention and effort to create a reality.

Intention: a purpose that aligns efforts

Secondary Origination: 1. an
unintended creation that is triggered by
the creation one intends.  2. an effort or
intention concerned with how a
primary origination is, was or will be
received.  3. an effort to monitor or
modify the origin point or receipt point
of a communication.  4. something that is
there other than what is knowingly
being created.  5. an unaligned effort.

Monitor n.: one who warns of faults or
informs of duty; an admonisher; one
who gives advice and instruction by way
of reproof or caution.

Monitor v.: to watch or check on; to
regulate the performance of; to listen in
on.
-----------------------------------------




Primary Origination


When an intention is unopposed by any other creation or
intention, it becomes effortlessly manifested as an experiential
reality. This is a primary origination.

When an intention encounters one or more prior creations or
opposing intentions, it triggers the prior creations or opposing
intentions into re-asserting themselves. This re-asserting is
called a secondary origination, or priorly created reality. A
common expression for this phenomenon is _doubt_.

Consciousness creating itself as the source of any reality may
transform that reality. Consciousness creating itself as the
no-source of a reality is powerless to affect that reality.

Consciousness exists within a span of time. Within that time it
may create against or modify its originations by subsequent

originations. This can be done before the origination manifests
into an experiential reality (changing one's mind). After an
origination has manifested, it must be experienced and
reintegrated before it can be replaced by a new origination.



--------------------------------------
Definitions:

Vectoring: combining forces into a
vector.

Vector: the resulting course followed
by events that are subject to multiple
influences.
--------------------------------------




A Practical Example


The voiced originations of students are often accompanied by
unvoiced secondary originations. For example, a student says he
is doing well, but unvoiced is the idea that he does not wish
the instructor to think he is slow. The resulting creation will
not clearly match either the voiced origination or the unvoiced
origination. This vectoring of intention results in the
experience of random creations.

Many secondary originations take the form of intentions to
create agreement, to solicit approval, or to avoid upset. These
prior realities can be triggered by a new primary origination.
They show up, often mentally, as second thoughts, reservations
or doubts. Sometimes they are involuntary, and the person may
not immediately be aware of them.

A secondary may appear as an effort to monitor, to convince, or
to check for approval for what is being originated.

At other times the secondary origination is not so much asking
for agreement with what is said, as it is asking if, or
asserting that, it is OK to speak.

These secondary originations sabotage us and keep our words from
manifesting into the realities that we wish to create.




So What Is A Primary Origination?


It is an origination that creates the reality the originated
words describe.

A primary origination (primary) does not look for agreement or
approval from any other source. A primary does not require
repeating, re-consideration, justification, or explanation. A
primary does not have to conform to or consult with past
experience. A primary is an origination that says "X" and
creates."X" as a reality. This is the way it is, _and it is!_

There are no mechanics, no technology, no fundamental truths
senior to consciousness acting as source creating a primary
origination. None!

A creation is subject to rules, principles, truths, and limits
only when it is created within a priorly created reality _that
one does not wish to disturb._

If you create in conflict with a priorly created reality, it
will, of course, re-assert itself as a secondary origination.

Many people will find that an understanding of the above and
re-acquiring the skill to make a primary origination will neatly
resolve their major difficulties in life.

The Creation Exercises


Exercise 1: Recognizing Secondaries


Purpose: To bring the student to a recognition of secondary
originations.

Procedure: Coach has the student deliver the first line from
the Source List, "I'm happy to be me." Coach then asks student
to tell him any doubts, second thoughts, or physical sensations
that the line triggers.

The exercise is done briefly and is complete as soon as the
student has an experiential clarity on recognizing secondary
originations.

NOTE: At this point, nothing is done with the secondaries other
than recognizing their existence as phenomena.




Exercise 2: Thoughtstorm(r) Session


Purpose: To use the mind deliberately.

Procedure:

1. Read the copy of the Thoughtstorm Instructions in your
personal folder.

2. Create (or join) a Thoughtstorm session on the subject of
"Secondary Originations," or lacking a group, contemplate the
following questions by yourself:

    * What are secondary originations?

    * What purpose, if any, do secondary originations
      serve?

    * What causes secondary originations?



----------------------------------------
Definitions:

Primary Origination: a creation or
communication invested with
sufficient intention and effort to
create a reality.

Intention: a purpose that aligns efforts

Secondary Origination:  1. an
unintended creation that is triggered
by the creation one intends.  2. an
effort or intention concerned with
how a primary origination is, was or
will be received.  3. an effort to
monitor or modify the origin point or
receipt point of a communication.  4.
something that is there other than
what is knowingly being created.  5. an
unaligned effort
----------------------------------------



----------------------------------------
Good Coaching Questions:

"Were you seeking my agreement for
what you said?"

"Were you looking for any approval
from me?"

"Did you expect me to reply?"

"Were you trying to say that in a
certain way?"

"Were you waiting for an
acknowledgement?"

"Did it require any extra effort to say
that?"

"Do you have any doubts that you
created the reality?"
----------------------------------------




Exercise 3: Sourcing Originations


Purpose: To allow the student to identity and assume control
over any secondary originations that act to curb or modify his
ability to source originations.

Procedure:

1. Avatar students work in pairs, each coaching the other in
turn.

2. At the beginning of each working session the coach has the
student reread the definitions of primary origination,
intention, and secondary origination, and give examples of each.

3. The coach has the student voice a statement from the Source
List as a primary origination and then observe or discover any
secondary originations that are occurring spontaneously before,
during or after the primary origination. If the student is
willing, the coach may point out any secondaries that he
observes, or ask questions that will reveal secondaries, (e.g.
"Were there any doubts, second thoughts, or physical sensations
triggered by that line.")

4. The coach helps the student to assume control over each
secondary that emerges by having the student deliberately
exaggerate that secondary alternating with giving the primary,
until the secondary no longer occurs spontaneously.

5. The exercise is continued until the student can easily
deliver any statement on the source list as a primary
origination without any self monitoring or secondary
originations occurring.




Additional Procedure Note:


The procedure may be unwieldy at first. The Avatar Master
will aid both the coach and the student to become proficient in
this exercise.

One may encounter resistances to doing the drill, but they
should be addressed the same as any other secondary. Once
secondaries begin to be eradicated the student will have little
doubt about the liberation achieved. Consciousness will
experience an expansion.

These exercises can get very noisy and funny. Laugh a lot and
lighten up. Consciousness is a very light thing.

----------------------------------------------------------------





[5A] SOURCE LIST


1. I am happy to be me.

2. I am right here.

3. This is really me.

4. I am me.

5. I do it.

6. I decide.

7. I am source.

(The Avatar Master will check out and give the final pass on
this exercise.)



-----------------------------------
Definitions:

Primary Origination: a creation
or communication invested with
sufficient intention and effort
for it to create a reality.

Intention: a purpose which
aligns efforts.

Secondary Origination:  1. an
unintended creation that is
triggered by the creation one
intends;  2. an effort or intention
concerned with how a primary
origination is, was or will be
received;  3. An effort to
monitor or modify the origin
point or receipt point of a
communication;  4. something
that is there other than what is
knowingly being created; 5. an
unaligned effort of any kind.
-----------------------------------




Exercise 4: Creating Reality


Purpose: To allow the student to identify and assume control
over any secondary originations that act to curb or modify his
ability to create his own reality.


Procedure:

1. Avatar students work in pairs, each coaching the other in
turn.

2. At the beginning of each working session the coach has the
student reread the definitions of primary origination and
secondary origination and give examples of each.

3. The coach has the student voice a statement from the reality
creation list below as a PRIMARY ORIGINATION and then locate any
secondary originations that are occurring spontaneously before,
during or after the primary origination. If the student is
willing, the coach may also point out any secondaries that he
observes, or ask questions that will elicit secondaries.

4. The coach helps the student to assume control over each
secondary origination that emerges by purposely having the
student exaggerate that secondary origination (as a secondary
origination) alternately with the primary until the secondary no
longer occurs spontaneously.

5. The exercise is continued until the student can easily
deliver any statement on the "Reality Creation List" as a
primary origination without any self-monitoring or secondary
originations occurring.




ADDITIONAL NOTES ON REALITY CREATION:


In creating reality, afirmations are made as primary
communications (self to self). When one is below the source
level of a prior created reality, the affirmation of the prior
created reality will show up as a secondary.

A reluctance to create a reality should be handled the same as
any other secondary.

Any reality experienced at variance with the primary origination
is the result of a secondary.

----------------------------------------------------------------





[5B] REALITY CREATION LIST


Each origination should be delivered as the student's own and it
should be repeated, with secondary originations handled, until
it creates the reality being communicated.


1. I feel the best I've ever felt.

2. I feel the worst I've ever felt.

3. Life is funny.

4. Life is serious.

5. I am here now.

6. I don't know where I am.

7. I feel like a victim.

8. I am not a victim.

9. The past doesn't exist.

10. I don't need forgiveness.

11. What I see is a problem.

12. What I see is a solution.

13. I don't have a choice.

14. I always have a choice.

15. Everything I see is illusion.

16. What I see is real.

17. I am as I decide to be.

18. There is a limit to what I'm willing to experience.

19. There is no limit to what I'm willing to experience.

20. I create what I experience.

21. I have everything I need.

22. My mind is still.

23. I am relaxed.

24. I create it all.

(The Avatar Master will check out and give the final pass
on this exercise.)



-------------------------------
The only answer to the question
"Can I..." is _yes._
-------------------------------




Exercise 5:


Create your own list of primary originations from your answers
to the following question:

    _What reality would the person I'd like to be create?_


Deliver each origination as your own, handling all secondaries,
until the origination creates the reality being communicated. In
some cases the reality will be created by the exercise alone. In
other cases the reality will manifest as a path, or opportunity,
leading to its creation.

-----------------------------------------------------------------





[6] CONGRATULATIONS

SECTION THREE

[0] FOREWORD


There are two fundamental abilities possessed by
consciousness; with them, one may manage existence. The first is
_Creation_, the process by which things enter existence, and the
second is _Discreation_, the process by which things exit
existence.

_Creation_ is the process of imagining the inexpressible no-
thing quality of consciousness into expressible quantities and
qualities.

_Discreation_ is the process of ceasing to imagine; ceasing to
create. It is terminating a response rather than creating a new
response against something.

_Creation_ is the journey from consciousness to existence.
_Discreation_ is the journey from existence back to
consciousness.

Response to _what is_ is the path of creation. Experience of
_what is_ is the path to consciousness.

The Avatar walks the path from consciousness to existence;

the Buddha walks the path from existence to consciousness. To
manage existence, one must learn to walk first as a Buddha and
then as the Avatar.


The CREATION HANDLING PROCEDURE is the path of the Buddha.

General Theory


Observation: Awareness creates within itself and experiences
within its creations.

When awareness chooses to experience its creation, it
becomes identified with that creation; it exists as that
creation. It does not respond _to_ the creation; it responds
_as_ the creation. While it is identified with the creation it
manifests as consciousness limited by the boundaries of the
creation. Defined consciousness believes itself separate from
the undefined awareness, which exists outside of the creation.

Since primal awareness is without limits, creation occurs
within it. Undefined awareness is the source of the first
creation. The limited consciousness existing as the creation
believes that it is existing within boundaries that are not of
its own creation. Limited consciousness considers itself
separate and different from undefined awareness. Limited
consciousness also creates within itself, but the limits of its
creations exist within the limits established by undefined
awareness.

Existing within limits that you consider beyond your power of
creation is the essence of experience. This is how people come
to view themselves as trapped or subject to experiences not of
their own creation.

The purpose of any creation is experience. There may or may
not be intervening steps between the act of the creation and the
integration of the experience. The complication is this: what
may seem a perfectly logical thing to create and experience by
an expanded consciousness may appear to be threatening to
experience by the more contracted aspect of the same
consciousness existing with the limits of the creation.

As an extreme example, an expanded consciousness existing
as thought energy might desire to experience how much weight a
particular organism might bear, but existing as the organism
that is being crushed, the experience is resisted. The degree of
desirability of an experience is relative to what you experience
_as_.

Thus limited consciousness resists (creates against experiencing
the creation created by a more expanded aspect of itself) _and
creating against oneself_ begins the compaction of creation and
consciousness that manifests as the physical universe.

The more expanded aspect of consciousness continues to create
the creation, on automatic, as a secondary origination to the
creations of the limited consciousness. Both are aspects of the
same source. When limited consciousness ceases to resist the
creation it is identified with, it expands beyond the boundaries
of that creation and integrates with the aspect of itself that
is source of the creation. The Creation Exercises in Section II
are preparation for this.

The limit or boundary of every experiential reality is an
unknown. Universes are separated by unknowns. If you wish to
examine an unknown more closely, pick out a little area of space
and study it independent of its limits, boundaries or reference
points.


Observation: What is created as unknown by consciousness as
creator is experienced as infinite space by consciousness as
experiencer.


If all of this leaves you hanging on by your mental fingertips,
don't be too concerned. The CREATION HANDLING PROCEDURE works
even if one does not fully understand it.


There are six steps to the Creation Handling Procedure;

    1. Identify with and experience

    2. Define the outermost limits

    3. Label it without judgment

    4. Disassociate from the creation

    5. Discreate the creation

    6. Create what you prefer

From 1992 Wizard's Lecture
(Section V of the Avatar(r) Materials)

"When we discuss space travel, realize
we are talking about a mental ability.
It has nothing to do with moving
biomass around the universe."

(c) 1992 by Harry Palmer
--------------------------------------



-----------------------------------------
Definition:

Continuum: a scale of changing
aspects which have a common factor,
e.g., an inch, a foot, a mile possess the
common factor of each being a
measure of distance.
-----------------------------------------




1. Identity With And Experience


Awareness within a creation is consciousness. Every creation
contains consciousness and is connected with every other
creation through pure awareness. Pure awareness is without
definition; it cannot be described as this or that, existing or
not. Only the creations of awareness exist. Consciousness is
awareness limited (defined) by a creation.

In the Feel-It Exercises of Section II, you learned to meld with
a creation and "feel how it feels." This is the essence of
"identify with and experience." It requires that you surrender
any resistance you might have to existing as the belief, the
feeling, the emotion, the idea, the identity, the time, the
space or the mass of whatever you are seeking to identify with
and experience. You become the limited expression of
consciousness that is the creation.

If a person has any difficulty doing this step, or just wants to
achieve a greater certainty on his ability to do this step, he
can employ the Creation Exercise. (For example: Create the
reality "I am ....[fill in the blank]..." and handle any
secondaries.)




2. Define The Outermost Limits


Every creation has some form, defined by boundaries, in one
or more of the infinite continuums of reality, time, space and
energy. Pains, sensations, aches have forms. Thoughts, ideas,
beliefs and impressions have forms. Fears, desires, and
compulsions have forms. Only pure awareness is boundless and
without form. Everything else has limits or boundaries defining
a _form_.

The creations which you feel the effect of are being viewed
from the inside--this is the relationship between creature and
creation. The creations which you have control over are being
generated by you--this is the relationship of creator and
creation.

Certain creations may require a change of continuum in order to
be viewed at all (e.g., a creation defined by a span of time,
such as a century, cannot be viewed in terms of spacial limits).

You cannot get an overall view of a creation which you are
being. To view such a creation requires that you expand the
reality that you consider yourself to be. This can be done by
extending your willingness to experience out in all directions
until you contact the unknowns which lie just beyond the limits
of the creation. Most people (aspects of consciousness) have
separate creations of self defined in different continuums,
e.g., an energy self, a reality self, a spacial self, a time
self.

You cannot change your relationship to an upset, pain, idea or
fear by resisting it.

You define a creation by expanding your attention within the
continuum or continuums in which it exists, and willingly
experiencing, until you contact the unknowns which lie just
beyond the borders of the creation.




3. Label It Without Judgment


When you label a defined creation without judgment, you recover
the attention that was fixed in the creation. Suddenly, _the
creation is what it is_. It does not compel you to create a
response. You are not the effect of, nor affected by, the
creation. You are not drawn into, nor repulsed from, the
creation. You are separate from it.

The key to this step is your ability to make a primary. The
label on a creation is a primary rather than a response. There
is no compromise, no check to see if you have done it right, no
pause for approval or applause. You are centered, sun-like,
Source.




4. Disassociate From The Creation


Very simply, you cease to identify with the creation. With your
attention on the creation, recognize: "This is not-I, this is my
creation."



------------------------------------
Present time is a creation whose
limits lie just beyond the moment.

Unknown (adj. used as n.): not
defined, identified, determined or
explored.



Events are creations defined by
limits in time (beginning and end).

Experiences are creations defined by
limits defined in awareness or
consciousness.
------------------------------------




5. Discreate The Creation


A creation in continuous automatic creation often needs to be
turned off. In truth, nothing hangs around (persists);
everything that exists is being created right now.

Discreate means to cease the creating of the creation. It is
effortless. It is a _halt to an existing flow_ of energy rather
than a new flow of energy. It is _not_ creating against the old
creation.

For example, when you turn off a light at the switch, you simply
interrupt, stop or take away the flow of energy to the light.
You discreate the light.

Deprived of "creating energy" the creation vanishes, breaks up
into parts and evaporates, shrinks into itself and disappears,
slips away, difuses, turns into a fog and dissipates, shrinks
into a nothingness, or is simply gone.

If you find something that you can't seem to discreate (a
persistent mass), it is because it still has a source of
"creating energy" which you have yet to assume responsibility
for.




6. Create What You Prefer


Determine what reality you would like to experience, using
excitement as your guide.

Construct a statement of the reality in the present tense. (For
example: I have inner peace.)

Originate the statement as a primary origination and handle any
doubts or secondaries by use of the Creation Handling Procedure
until the reality is experienced, OR until a clear path of
opportunity to the reality opens to you.





IMPORTANT NOTE: _Remember that nothing in the Avatar
materials is meant to limit you or your powers of creation. If,
inadvertently, something has crept into the materials that
constitutes a belief or a limitation for you, please discreate
that, also._

[2] CREATION HANDLING PROCEDURE (Transcript)

(Revised and reissued by Star's Edge International 3/15/92
to update and replace "Creation Handling Procedure" lecture
transcript in current Avatar Course Section III)



Yesterday, I gave you the steps of a procedure that can create
an Avatar. Today, I'll explain the six steps further and answer
any questions you have about them.

Briefly, the six steps are: identify, define, label,
disassociate, discreate, and create. These six steps describe
the operation of awareness in the universe.

Well, actually, there are seven steps. There is one step that
was left out, which is the step you start with--exist. I assume,
since you are doing the Avatar Rundowns, that you are
existing--it's an addiction, you know.

(laughter)

appointed to stand in place of
------------------------------




Step 1


So you start off with whatever you are resisting, and the first
step of the Creation Handling Procedure is to _identify with it
and really experience it_. Really feel it. Take the resist off
and really sink into it. Become it.

Anything that exists has a form in some dimension, and anything
which has a form can be experienced. Those things which aren't
in creation are without form and assume surrogate existences by
identifying with forms--like Avatars.

The only problem anybody ever has with experiencing a creation
comes from the fact that they are already identified with
another creation that is incompatible with the creation they are
trying to experience--round pegs don't fit in square holes,
flesh and blood bodies don't do well in the core of the sun.

From the formless state of Avatar you can go back and forth into
existence and get a good feel for the limits of anything you
wish to experience.

When you are contained within the creation, you experience the
creation. You are the experiencer. When the creation is 
contained within you, you are the source of the creation. You
are the creator.

From inside, you experience; from outside, you create. Whatever
you are experiencing was created from a more expanded state of
consciousness than the state of consciousness from which you are
experiencing it. Your life is designed by you as a higher
self--relax and enjoy, EXPERIENCE and GROW!

We can imagine creators and gods and collective consciousnesses,
all separate from us, all out there somewhere--separate because
we are locked into our little spheres of creation that we have
yet to experience.

When you start to experience, you grow. Experiencing means you
stop thinking and start feeling. Thinking is a continuous
creating to avoid experiencing.

If you're resisting an experience, you're creating against
experiencing it. That's OK. You just have to experience your
creation of resistance first. Whatever you're involved in, the
path out is to fully experience it--even if it's resisting an
experience. Experiencing fulfills the purpose for why you
created it.

To experience something you have to suspend judgment. You relax
into it. It's not an effort, it's a relax, a release into. To
experience means to accept something, to overcome your fear and
to go exploring a little bit. It's to transform your fear into
curiosity. It's feeling it.

You know, there's breathing from the stomach, and there's
breathing higher in the diaphragm. Well, feeling is down here
(stomach). To experience something, you just breath with the
experience, sinking into it and identifying with it. It's like
getting into a hot tub. Just ease on in. You become the reality
that you are focusing on. That's step one, _experience what
you've already identified with_. Later on, when you've
experienced what you're already identifed with, you can identify
with and experience something different.




Step 2


The next step is to _define what you're identified with_. We're
talking about define in the sense of: to establish the limits,
define the outside, to delineate, to circumscribe, to get a
sense of the outline in which something is contained. That's
define.

Every creation has boundaries. That may take some getting used
to, because sometimes the boundaries exist in realms that you
are only vaguely aware of. When you explore boundaries from the
inside, you expand your attention outward into whatever you are
experiencing. The boundaries will be perceived as a marked
decrease in the intensity of the experience.

When you look at the boundaries of a creation from the outside,
the intensity of experience of the creation is very slight. The
more your attention is drawn into the creation, the more the
intensity increases. It's the difference between watching an
accident on the news and being involved in one.

The degree of intensity in your life is determined by the
creations you are identified with but are resisting. To an
Avatar, existence is effortless.

I've got a story I'll tell you. I've told this story before. You
have to picture something. Picture clear transparent space.
Imagine perfectly clear transparent space above you as far as
you can put out your awareness, clear transparent space. To the
right of you as far as you can possibly imagine, clear
transparent space. To the left of you, as far as you can
imagine, clear transparent space. In front of you, as far as you
can imagine, clear transparent space. Behind you, as far as you
can imagine, clear transparent space. Below you, clear
transparent space. Everywhere, clear transparent space. And you
are everywhere in this endless, clear transparent space. Relax
and feel it. There is nothing to resist.

(pause)

Suddenly you find this little tiny particle in your clear
transparent space.

Now where do you think that came from? Huh? A tiny little
particle in your clear transparent space. You decide to ignore
it and just enjoy your clear transparent endless space. But
where does your attention go? On the particle. So you resist it
and what happens? It becomes more real.

There is a little tiny particle in your clear transparent space!
And it's mysterious because it's unknown! It is so miniscule,
compared to your infiniteness, that it radiates an intensity of
experience so slight that it borders on the non-existent. Like
looking into a flashlight beam on the moon, from the Earth! Dim!

And you look at this particle in your clear transparent space.
And you look, and you look, and you look. Your attention becomes
totally focused on this little particle. And what happens? As
your attention focuses, you grow smaller! And the intensity of
the experience radiated by the particle grows stronger. And you
look. And you shrink. And the intensity grows. And you look. And
you shrink. And the intensity grows. And the particle doesn't
seem to be quite so small anymore. And you look. And you shrink.
And the intensity grows. And you look. And you shrink. And the
intensity grows. The particle gets a little bigger. And you
look. And you shrink. And the intensity grows. The particle gets
bigger still. You look. And you shrink. And the intensity grows.
The particle grows so big that you can look inside of it! And
you look. And you shrink. And the intensity grows. And you go
"Whoa!" and look and shrink, some more. You go "Wow," and you
look and shrink and the intensity grows so strong that you go
right into the particle! It's a whole universe! Suns and
planets, stars, galaxies! This is really intense. You look at
this planet inside the particle called Earth and you shrink and
the intensity grows. Very interesting this planet called Earth.
You look, you shrink, the intensity grows...

So now, dry your baby tears and look around. You look out into
the universe from within a creation, within a creation, within a
creation, within a particle...it's space...clear transparent
space!

(Applause)

Looking from the inside out, space, from the outside in,
curious, mystery, interesting, which is why you tend to get
yourself identified with things.

So when you feel you are satisfied with experiencing something,
maybe you've learned something or just got bored, you are ready
to define it. _Define the outermost limits_ is step two of the
Creation Handling Procedure. You expand out, permeate out, until
you are aware of a marked decrease in intensity. Expand far
enough and you will contact clear transparent space.

So this is the how you define, when whatever you are
experiencing just doesn't seem to extend any further--intensity
has dropped to zero. That's it. Do this in several directions,
or every direction at once, or however you want to until you get
some sense of the form of what you are experiencing.

OK? That's the definition.




Step 3


Now, we come to this step _label it without judgment_.

The problem with judgment is that when you attach your belief
to something, you also attach you to it. You start to dribble
down this judgment anchored on some creation. A judgment is a
belief. You placed a belief on a creation. Now, you either drag
the creation around with you or you go into the creation and
start to experience it, but you experience it in accord with
your belief. Oh! Oh! It's sort of like an octopus waking up one
morning and finding out that he is all in his toes!

The saying should read, "Judge not, lest ye become the judged!"

So you label the creation without judgment. You label it just as
it is. It is what it is. Make very sure that your label isn't a
response to the creation. Your label is a primary, not a
response to the creation. Let the creation be its own label. Let
it be just as it is and let that be its label. The creation and
the label are the same. If you have trouble labeling something
just as it is, experience your judgment of it, define your
judgment of it and label your judgment just as it is. Do you
understand? The beginning is always right where you are.

When you label a creation without judgment you experience a
change of viewpoint. You go from inside to outside--from
connected to separate. You have a change in perspective. You're
no longer identified with the creation. The intensity of
experience of the creation falls to zero.

And when you are outside of a creation, you begin to recognize
yourself as separate from the creation and source of your
response to the creation. In fact, when you take your attention
off it, the creation doesn't even exist as far as you're
concerned. It's your creation! Marvelous stuff, this material!
Amazing!

If you label the physical universe just as it is, and you also
include your body and mind as part of the physical universe and
label it all just as it is, you will experience a shift in
viewpoint from within the physical universe to a vague sense of
being outside the physical universe.


------------------------------------
Birth and death are the experiential
boundaries of life
------------------------------------


I don't know if any of you have carried the label-it exercise to
that point yet, but it's there! It's there within a very few
minutes. The state may be vague and easy to doubt at first, but
I would say that it will take no more than an hour to experience
it as a reality.

When you reach this point, the things in the universe are your
thoughts!

Maybe you'd better tell someone who understands before you do it
or you're likely to come back and find yourself locked in a
sanitarium, but I'd expect you'd be able handle that in short
order. The insane are insane, not only because they violate what
other people believe, but because they _insist on telling_ the
other people about it! Shut up and enjoy the experience.

And when you start to experience the universe from the outside,
which is a much nicer viewpoint, you get some pretty good ideas
about what you want to be involved in and what you would just
as soon pass on. All by itself, label it without judgment is a
powerful process.

When you label other people without judgment, it becomes a
religious experience.




Step 4


Step 4 is _disassociate from the creation_.

The universe is a creation that arises in infinite
awareness--clear transparent awareness. Awareness is the creator
and the perceiver until it identifies itself with some creation
and become something with boundaries. You are bound only by your
own decision to have boundaries!

Now if you can see it, it's what?

It's the creation. If you can be aware of it, it's what? It's
the creation. If it's got form, it's what? Creation, right? So
the recognition that something is a creation, that it's not
infinite awareness, disassociates you from it.

_A creation is not-I_. You're no longer identified with it. Once
you see it, you can disassociate from it. Now you don't have to
see it in any great detail as long as you can define its
boundaries. Very simple. Very powerful.

And when you disassociate from the creation, you recognize that
it is your decision whether you create something or not. You're
the source of the creation, which you must be. I mean if you
didn't exist, it wouldn't. It's like the Beatles song, "What do
you see when you turn out the lights? I can't tell you, but _I
know it's mine._"

Anything you experience is in your universe, and because it is
your universe, _it is your creation_. Even if it's a copy of
something from some other universe, the copy is your creation.

If I tell you about a green bottle, what you imagine is your
copy of it. Your copy of a green bottle in your universe. Do
what you want with it--it's yours!

Does that make sense to you?

So we add this second line to the disassociate step, _this is my
creation_. And the whole thing goes like this: _Recognize, this
is not-I, this is my creation_.




Step 5


Step 5 is _discreate_.

I use the word _discreate_ because I want to use something which
shows there isn't any effort in it. It's not a creation against
what's there; it's turning off what's there (dis- not). It's
stopping the flow that's creating it. It's halting the creating
energy that you're feeding into the creation.

It's not an effort you make. It's the absence of creation; it's
the absence of effort. It's yours and you're creating it, and
suddenly, you decide you're not going to create it anymore.
That's discreation.

One of the curious things about this universe is if you create
something and you're not willing to experience it, you keep
right on creating it. It will wait for you! However long it
takes! Creation and experience, it's like inhale and exhale.

So, if you're creating something, maybe a creation directed
toward another, and you say, "Oh no! Gee, I don't want to
experience that..."

You will.

The only element is time. It's sooner or later. It's perfect
karma. For both the good and the bad.

And while you're waiting to experience, while you're putting it
off by resisting, it's burning up your creating energy.

If you consider a creation from the point of view of an outside
source that created it, the creation is going to be there until
it is experienced. Once it's experienced, it ceases to be
created. It's integrated into the whole of awareness, and then
it's time for the next creation.

A creation can be anything: any event, any idea, any upset, any
impression. You continually create it in each new moment of time
until it's experienced. Exhale, inhale. It's your universe!



-----------------------------------
"This is the best argument I have
made yet for intentionally creating
something nice for another to
experience."

Harry Palmer in reference to Step 5
-----------------------------------




Step 6


Step 6 is _create_.

First of all, you won't experience anything you don't believe,
so the creations you create to experience have to be constructed
with enough logical support so that you're willing to believe
them.

Of course, you can create a past for them. You can create
believable circumstances by which the belief will manifest.

If you're failing and you want to be successful, you can say,
"OK. I'm successful."

Well, it's going to take a little time to believe that if your
interpretation of your experience is that you're failing. And
you're resisting failing. How many successful people started off
by experiencing failure? They experienced it and got failure out
of the way so they could go on and be successful, right?

How about if you created that for the last fifty lifetimes
you've been preparing for success. You have developed the skill
to see any situation from a point of view of spotting the
opportunities in it. Success is an inherent skill that comes
with being you. It's as much a part of you as breathing. You
can't do anything but succeed. You just stumble into success,
because you've been prepared for it for so long. You can't help
being a success. And then suddenly, in your clear transparent
space of success, there is this little particle of failure...

No, no, whatever you do, don't look at it.

(laughter)

So there you are.

You are creating experience. You're creating the reality you
prefer. You're creating an incarnation for yourself. You're
fulfilling the prophecy of the Avatar, which is defined as a
deity that can incarnate itself in its own creation.

Which you've always done anyway!

Now the next question, which is still part of the step six
creation, is how far can you push this procedure? Can you create
yourself to fly? Can you create anti-gravity about your body and
make it float? Can you create yourself to disappear? I guess it
depends upon what you have already identified yourself with.

How far you can go is something that only you can explore. It
is probably different for different explorers.

Does that make the Creation Handling Procedure clearer? It's a
six step, very simple, very powerful technique.

You can handle anything you can experience: beliefs, desires,
somatics, pains, sensations, emotions, attitudes, upsets,
problems, opportunities--anything you can experience. It's a Jim
Dandy overall gizmo!




Questions?

Question: What if you're trying to discreate something and it
hangs up, it doesn't discreate?

Harry: If it continues, it must be getting creating energy from
some source that you haven't yet recognized or experienced as
you.

Question: Let's say you have a creation and it has a lot of
parts to it, attitudes about it, and physical manifestations on
it. You know, ...there's all these parts to it. Different parts.
Do you have to take each part separately and do the steps on it?
Or could you just take the whole thing...

Harry: Understand, what you believe is going to influence how
you're going to have to handle it. I'll tell you what I believe.
I believe you can just experience the whole thing at once, but
if you believe that you have to take it apart piece by piece--go
back 75 million years and locate basic or whatever--you're going
be hung with that creation until you handle the beliefs about
what it will take to discreate it.

Comment: It's all beliefs. That's the realization I had on it.
So you can believe whatever you want to.

Harry. I believe so.

Comment: This morning we were talking about being spheres of
individual consciousness within a single larger sphere of
consciousness, and probably that larger sphere of consciousness
shares another even larger sphere of consciousness with spheres
of its comparable size. Will you comment on that analogy?

Harry: Sure. It's a good model to explain why consciousness

seems to integrate in stages. First, we become one with those
that we really truly love, the spheres that are like us.

Question: What if there is someone that you really wouldn't
want to integrate with?

Harry: Think of the worst, god-awful guy you can imagine. You
have some idea of him, right? Well, it's your creation. It's
yours, and if you refuse to experience it, sooner or later...
(laughter) it's waiting for you.

Comment: I'm just very amazed with it all.

Harry. Well, it is amazing. You've taken the lid off of
psychology, philosophy, physics and have waded into the field of
parapsychology with your eyes wide open. Avatar just unravels it
all.

Comment: Seems like when you're creating your new image, the
Creation Handling Procedure process is working backwards from
discreate to experience. Is that correct?

Harry: Yes it is. And each step on the process is typical of
certain set of life experiences.

Comment: Sure gives you a nice clean slate, you know!

Harry: Yes, it does. It gives you a chance to start over. Clears
the decks for action.

Comment: Always before, it seemed to me that I was trying to
write over something that had already been written. I'd get real
positive and assert something like, 'I'm going to be rich," "I'm
going to be rich"" I'm going to be rich." You know, asserting
the affirmation "I'm going to be rich," "I'm going to be rich."
Tape it on the mirror. Say it every morning. But you know if I
was feeling the need to assert it that way, what do you think my
real belief was?
(Laughter)

Comment: That would explain the, "It's always darkest before the
dawn" phenomenon. Creating counters creating. Finally you just
quit counter-creating and experience the creation. Then it falls
away and you're left with the creation that you were trying to
create all along.

Comment: I'll give you an experience I had last week. I went to
the Midwest Branch to handle a business problem. This was a very
stable business for many many years. Anyhow, the statistics of
two individuals in the sales department crashed miserably. I
mean they really crashed. I was trying to figure out what the
problem was. I sat down and the first thing at the meeting, the
guy who is directing sales and is one of the people whose
personal sales had crashed, tells me about these new signs. And
to make a long story short, they had adopted a new policy. They
had constructed a bunch of signs that--you know how they have
"no smoking" signs and they have a circle with a line through
it-- these signs said "No negs." The whole idea was anybody who
said anything that was the least bit negative, they'd pull out
these little signs and humiliate them. (Laughter)

The point is, the people who were the most caved in and the most
negative (and still are, by the way) were the ones who were
protesting any negative statement! And their "no neg" policy was
a negative statement. Here are people in sales who have to go
out and make sales against all kinds of negative response, and
they are saying, "Don't hit me with a neg, I'm too sensitive."
It was incredible.
(Laughter)

Harry. What you resist...

Are you ready to go to work?

Audience: Yeah!

Harry: Good. Thank you!

[3] DEFINE IT

A revised transcript of a lecture
given by Harry Palmer




How are you doing?

(Audience: Good!)

Well, there are some bits and pieces that I want to go over with
you. This technology keeps growing. It's really exciting from a
research point of view. The Avatar process just keeps digging
deeper and deeper. And while we're actually starting to hit
limitations now, they are so far beyond the prior point of being
limited, that we never had any idea that these limitations even
existed. So we're starting to expand into some pretty wild
stuff-alternate realities, different levels of consciousness,
group consciousness, mass consciousness, some really far out
stuff. I want you to be aware of them so if you hit something
unusual you're not thrown into doubt about your sanity or
immediately invalidate or limit yourself from experiencing it.
Our ability to limit ourselves seems to be unlimited. So I
really want to tell you truly, in the truest sense of the word,
you are explorers.

(Audience: Great!)

I want to start off with the idea of _victim_. We've all run
into the idea of somebody being a victim, or being victimized,
or appearing to be a victim and we've all run into the idea, at
least abstractly, that "There are really no victims." Nobody can
really be a victim of another's creation. The guy is just
pretending to be a victim to screw our minds, or worse. And the
viewpoint that I had, carried of victim for a long time, was a
victim is trying to communicate that you're bad source. In a
way, he actually has this evil intention, that he's putting out
to you to tell you that you have done something really bad, and
that he's a victim of your actions. _This was the old
viewpoint_.

Recently some Avatar researchers have been telepathically
exploring dolphin consciousness. (I told you that there are some
limitations that are coming off on this Avatar material.)

One of the things that several have experienced is being able to
contact and actually communicate with dolphins. Or so they
believe. (It's up to you whether you want to believe it or not)
Anyway, they've been learning some really neat lessons, new
viewpoints. One thing-dolphin consciousness is really playful
and is almost entirely absent of any desire to own or possess.
It has escaped the seriousness of most land games. It's very
light, it's joyful, it's enthusiastic . . . from my personal
experience, it's very nice.

So when the researchers were able to discreate all association
with their land bodies, they went off to play in dolphin bodies.
Instead of recreating a humanoid body, they created a cetacean
body. And the dolphins have been teaching the researchers, by
example, an enormous amount of stuff.

An interesting game, the dolphins would keep getting into these
situations from which the researchers would need to save them.
They'd start to get trapped in fish nets, stranded on sand bars,
swim into the wake of ships, all sorts of near disasters that
they'd have to be warned away from. The more the researchers
interrelated with them, the more they kept finding themselves in
the roles of savior. And eventually, as the researchers gained
enough courage to relate their experiences to each other, they
began to realize that the dolphins were playing a game with
them, and the game was the "save" game. And the dolphins would
get into a situation where the researchers could save them
because it would make the researchers feel so good to save them.
It was a really wonderful game reflective of the researcher's
needs and desires.

It made them feel strong and very proud to save the dolphins.
And it took awhile for them to realize that it was the game they
were playing.

Dolphins also play saviors and save each other. The first
interrelation between dolphin and man was stories of sailors
being saved by dolphins. So the dolphin "save" game has been
around for awhile.

So I took another look at this idea that nobody is really a
victim and that they are just trying to cave us in by showing us
these bad effects. I realized that the beings, who are going
around being victim in human form, are really doing or
attempting to do a service to the rest of us. They're playing
the save game, you know. They are allowing us to feel very
strong and powerful to save them.

So the next time you look at a victim and you say "Hey, he's
faking it and I ought to kick him," instead, recognize that he's
trying to be of service to you. It's a lot easier to experience.
Get back into the dolphin consciousness. It's a game--come play,
you know, fun! No victims.

Another thing is this unknown/known factor. Let me give you an
idea of unknowingness--consciousness has the ability to unknow
something. Have you ever written a letter to somebody, and then
put the pen down and reread the letter, not knowing what you had
written, so you could imagine how they would receive the letter
that you had written?

Most of us have.

A universe is composed of layers of know, unknow, know, unknow,
know, unknow. When I say we're starting to explore new frontiers
with this material, I'm not exaggerating. If you shrink down to
the smallest sub-atomic particle, you're going to find
consciousness in the state of unknow, know. If you start to
explore realities, you're going to find that realities are
separated by dream states, which are the unknowns. So you have
reality, dream state, reality, dream state, reality, dream
state. "As above, so below," goes the old metaphysical adage.

A thought is bordered by, limited by, an unknown. From inside
the creation you can actually put your attention out and at
some point you hit blankness. Unknowness. It's like contacting
infinite space. All of a sudden it gets mysterious. Even if you
continue to create something, you will eventually hit the limit
of your imagination.

What imagining is, by the way, is getting data across an
unknown. You pull data from another reality, across an unknown,
and sometimes factors in the unknown alter the data. The data
you end up with may not be predictable since you had to filter
it through an unknown.

When you expand out and reach this unknown, you have a sense of
the form of the thought you're holding, the belief you're
holding, the desire, whatever you've been experiencing. That's
what we mean by define the limits of it Very simple.

Occasionally you may find yourself, after some confusion or
something, sitting in the middle of an unknown, experiencing an
unknown between two knowns. It's an interesting sort of
experience. It's doubt and indecision. It's anxiety and stress.
It's a no-man's land of disbelief. It's the la-la land of
paranoia and psychosis. The people who resist the realities on
both sides of this unknown, for example someone who hates mother
(one reality) and hates father (one reality) live in the dream
state. They tend to be very uncertain. So Avatar has laid this
whole can of worms wide open as well

If you try to experience an unknown, it reduces to a sort of a
tension between two knowns. An uneasy peace. The first time
people ran into one of these, they were ready to forget Avatar
and find religion. After we figured out what was happening and
how to handle it, it lost its kick and then everyone wanted to
experience being stuck in an unknown. So which would you rather
be, skinned alive or boiled in oil? Kiss a mummy or lick a
banana slug? Eat a worm or shampoo with jam?

Get the idea? You sit right in the middle, between two
creations, neither of which you want anything to do with. Well,
you can either pick one and ease into it or learn to live with
the doubt. As long as you're experiencing something, even if
it's mysterious, you can expand until you hit the unknown around
it, but if you're not experiencing anything, it's an unknown.
When you expand out, you'll run into what you were resisting. So
experience resisting it, define it, label it, disassociate and
discreate it and you're on your way again. It was a minor glitch
that you've handled.

(Audience: Can you clarify about the unknown that borders
something? Is it an actual outline, or data, or what?)

Harry: It's a fuzzy band, I mean it's not necessarily a really
sharp, distinct line but it's a space that as you pass through
it, there is a change in what your attention is on. Sometimes,
you'll even forget what you were thinking about. You will forget
what you were thinking about, because you passed through the
unknown that bordered what you were experiencing. You can
reorient yourself back to experience, or just proceed and label
whatever it was without judgment--is this real to you?

(Audience: Yes.)

Now, what is a self? You will find that a self is some
consciousness that's been bordered in an unknown, right? When
you penetrate that unknown you will experience a loss of self-
identity.

It's OK because you're just integrating into a larger self. It
takes a little while to integrate. Sometimes when you come out
of a session and you've been doing this process you just want to
hang out for awhile. Well, you penetrated an unknown, and of
course that was basically how you kept who you were bottled or
circumscribed or however you want to phrase it. And when you
penetrated that, it's just like . . . dispersed. And it takes
awhile until you hit the next unknown and get a new sense of
definition. Each time you penetrate an unknown you will end up
with this larger sense of self, a greater self, a higher self if
you want to call it that. Eventually you eliminate the need for
any definition at all.

(Question: What about channeling?)

Harry: I would guess that channeling is some technique of
penetrating, maybe several barriers of unknown or several
different layers of unknown all at once and communicating to a
higher level of consciousness.

(Question: How would you handle chronic aches and pains
that don't stem from any apparent physical source?)

Harry: Well, you're getting into persistent masses which
exist in shells of knowns and unknowns and you can just peel
away at them. First you experience your resistance to the
chronic condition--if it's persisting, there is some resistance.
Experience the judgments on the chronic condition. They are
creations that prevent you from experiencing and discreating the
core of the condition. Just peel them off. You may also find
there are some resisted identities connected with the condition
as well. Just experience the resistance and peel them off as
well. If you stop making progress, button-hole a master and coax
him to work with you in guided sessions.

Do you have any questions, or comments, statements?

One other question that sometimes comes up: A person will have a
pain and they handle it and they wonder "where did it go?" Well,
if you consider _all that is_, nothing can go anyplace. So the
somatic is actually one focus of consciousness and what the
person is doing is changing his focus of consciousness. He's
creating an alternate reality where he doesn't hurt And all
possibilities of realities exist simultaneously and it's your
choice which one you choose to focus on. Now if the pain is part
of a reality that also contains sympathy or achievement, you may
choose to live with the pain as the price of focusing on that
reality.

(Audience: OK. Now when you speak of shells, could you look at
that in a sense as alternate realities that are bordered by
unknowns? You get a big convolution. Could you really get a real
package there? You got evaluation, unknown, evaluation, the
whole thing snares.)

Harry: It sure can. I think there is an infinity of
possibilities. I don't want to give you any kind of data that
limits you in any idea that there are certain realities that you
must experience or can't experience and other realities that you
can experience. Because we are really at the point now of
exploring realities and the only entrance door to a reality is
that you believ you can experience it.

We're handling the mind from a totally mechanical point of view.
What it means, what the significance is, is up to you. You are
likely to find that the significance sucks you in, because you
wouldn't be stuck in the middle of something if it wasn't just
absolutely the most fascinating thing you could imagine.

Keep me posted on how you are doing. Bye!

[4] SUMMARY


1. Identify with the creation and experience it.

2. Define the creation by expanding to its outermost limits.

3. Label the creation just as it is without judgment.

4. Disassociate from the creation. Recognize: "This is not-I. 
   This is my creation."

5. Discreate the creation. Turn it off.

6. Create the reality you prefer.



_Two important phenomena to recognize_


The creation you are handling may resolve (discreate) at any
point during the five steps of the procedure. If the creation
vanishes, it is gone. Discreated. Often, merely focusing your
awareness on a creation with the intention of discreating it is
sufficient to discreate it. Little is gained by recreating it
just to complete the procedure.

If after step 5 of the procedure, one perceives that he still
has some creation that he does not choose to have, he
simply begins over with the Identify with and Experience
step (step 1).

And finally, imagine, that whatever idea you create of me, it
flows unconditional love to that idea you create of you.
Lovingly, joyfully, be it all. In love, Harry Palmer 1987.

PART II
-------




[1] INITIATION


The Avatar rundowns begin with an introductory or initiation
session guided by an Avatar Master. The purpose of the
initiation is to aid you in achieving an experiential clarity of
the workability of the Creation Handling Procedure.

You may have many things you want to handle, the Master may or
may not take these up in this session. His main concern is that
you achieve confidence in using the procedure. You will have
many hours of solo work and further guided sessions in which to
handle whatever you wish.

Let your course supervisor know when you are ready for
your initiation session.

-----------------------------------------------------------------





[2] AVATAR COURSE GOALS


There are three main products that the Avatar materials
are known to produce. They are:


    1. A satisfactory, self-discernible increase in the ability
       to handle life.

    2. Recognizable gains.

    3. A preparedness to meet the future.


Before certifying Avatar completions or issuing certificates,
the student should be asked the following (and only the
following) questions to ascertain if these products have been
achieved.

The answers he gives are the _only, only, ONLY_ criteria for
determining if satisfactory results have been achieved with the
Avatar Materials.

It is not up to the Avatar Master to make any judgments
on any criteria other than the unprompted answers to the
following:


    1. Do you feel you have achieved a satisfactory
    increase in the ability to handle life?
    (If the answer is "no," don't continue. Find out
    why and write a program to handle.)

    2. What recognizable gains have you made?
    (If no gains, don't continue. Find out why and
    write a program to handle.)

    3. Do you feel more prepared to meet the future?


(If the answer is no, don't continue. Find out why
and write a program to handle.)

Providing all the above are answered in the positive, the
student should be extended the awards and respect due an Avatar.

Should the above questions turn up something that needs
to be handled, the Avatar Master should write a debug program
(per Avatar Master series _De-Bugging Avatar_) and get the
product that is missing.

From the data at hand, consisting of over three thousand
hours of Avatar processing, and many, many Avatar completions,
the above increases and gains are _easily_ and uniformly
achievable.

In my estimation, any student not able to achieve these
results should come to a Star's Edge delivery for a _free_
review.

(Free reviews by Star's Edge Trainers shall be a standard
part of any delivery agreement made with any Center trained and
authorized to deliver the Avatar materials.)

PART III: RUNDOWNS
------------------





[1] AVATAR BODY HANDLING RUNDOWN


The identity-complex which is thought of as "I" maintains its
association with the physical body-idea by a pattern of
impressions it creates of the body.

On first inspection, it may seem to the "I" that the impressions
he has of the body are only sensory feedback of a purely
physical or biological nature. Understand that this is so only
because the "I" believes it. And as long as "I" believes it, "I"
will imagine the impressions it experiences of the body as
originating in the body and have nothing to do with the idea
that the impressions are his creation.

The individual will assert that sight, sound, feeling, etc., are
sensations _of_ the body and that he is not dealing with
impressions upon consciousness. He is not likely to treat kindly
any suggestion you might make about him "imagining" that he
sees, or imagining that he feels, etc. Nor should you attempt to
launch into any great proofs or demonstrations of the _idea_
that his senses are his own imagined translations of various
electronic signals originating from specialized body organs.
Just steer him into the process and let him run with it.

Long-term association or familiarity with a particular idea or
impression will give that idea or impression a sense of realness
that renders it nearly invisible to inspection as an idea. It's
so familiar that it must be real. It's taken for granted. It's
the realness that one can come back to after entertaining
fanciful ideas that are less familiar. It's the old pain in the
back that's hurt since the days of the pyramids and now is just
part of what association with a body feels like. A trick in
spotting these long term body impressions is to compare the
impressions one has of the body while awake to the impressions
one has of the body while asleep.

The person will often find that he is associated with many
(sometimes sixty or more) layered impressions of the body. Each
of these impressions is a thought form that contains old
beliefs, created images, or dormant energies. The layers of
impressions are in perpetual create and act to mold the body,
generally to the body's detriment.



--------------------------------
Definitions:

An Impression: the first or
immediate effect of a perception
upon consciousness. An
impression may be an image or
a sensation.

An Idea: an impression that
has been re-created and worked
over.

An Identity: a self-image; an
image of self; a collection of
ideas that serves as a
manifestation of consciousness.
--------------------------------



Disassociation from and discreating certain impressions or
complete layers of impressions, particularly those that have
"resistance" created in them, may produce energy phenomena
similar to mild convulsions.

One may encounter present time impressions containing what seem
to be past impressions. Just realize that it's all happening now
and the past would not exist if it were not being created in the
moment. We don't, as some psychological practices would have you
believe, drag the past around with us. We create it moment to
moment as it serves to support our beliefs about what a
past ought to be.

(Remember, body conditions are created coincident with a
creation of historical association with disaster and injury to
make them dependably _real_. If you have any doubt of this,
explore earlier conditions that are similar sometime. Certain
conditions even appear to have their creation source in the
past, but since the past no longer exists, one has to wonder
where the condition's "creating energy" comes from.)

The content or meaning of body impressions is of no particular
interest Don't get side-tracked on trying to figure out what the
impression means, or where it came from--of course it's
interesting and fascinating, you wouldn't be continuously
creating it if it weren't.

You handle body impressions as follows: first, identify with and
experience the impression; second, define by expanding one's
awareness in every dimension, mental and physical, to the
unknown that borders and gives the impression form; third, label
the impression without judgment; fourth, disassociate from the
impression by recognizing, "This is not-I. This is my creation";
fifth, permit it to discreate, turn off its "creating energy."

As more and more impressions are discreated, many students
report passing into a more or less lucid dream state. Learning
to pass into, and through, this dream state while remaining
awake and aware, opens doors to some of the most remarkable,
extraordinary experiences. Perhaps even an insight into the
phenomena of death. Enjoy your explorations.

The body handle process is done solo, either supervised or
unsupervised. The CREATION HANDLING PROCEDURE fully applies.




PROCEDURE


Select a quiet, comfortable and relaxed space.


    1. _Identify_ with the overall impression you have of your
       body.

    2. _Define_ the impression by expanding your awareness in
       every dimension until you contact the unknown (space)
       that encloses that impression.

    3. _Label without Judgment_ the overall form that now
       contains the impression. A viewpoint shift from "inside"
       to "outside" will occur.

    4. _Disassociate from_ the creation by addressing it with:
       "This is not-I. This is _my_ creation."

    5. _Discreate_. Stop creating it, turn off its "creating
       energy."

    6. Repeat 1-5 until you no longer have any impression of any
       part of your body (e.g., the sense you have of your body
       when you dream).




RE-CREATION STEP

    7. When you are ready, create an impression of your body
       that you choose to have. Construct a primary
       origination(s) that expresses that creation. Using the
       Creation Exercises from Section II, create your new
       impression as a reality.
       Recognize that any impression that shows up other than
       the one you wish to create is a _secondary origination_.
       Handle the secondary with steps 1-5 above and continue
       the primary origination until it creates the reality you
       prefer. This process may take anywhere from a few minutes
       to several hours. When your impression of the incarnation
       seems to    originate from the incarnation itself, you have
       achieved success.

----------------------------------------------------------------





[2] NO LIMIT BEING

A revised transcript of a lecture
given by Harry Palmer



The name of this lecture is "No Limit Being." _No limit_.

First of all I want to tell you about some of the wins that
people have had on the Avatar Process. Unbelievable! They
stretch your credibility. People are handling things that they
couldn't handle in any other way, things that they've spent
their entire life trying to handle. And they are handling them
in days, hours, minutes--unbelievable! _Unbelievable!_

We're into an incredibly high realm of ability with these Avatar
materials. We're actually tip-toeing into the mass
consciousness. Let me explain.

Mass consciousness has certain beliefs that it contains and it
sort of determines how reality will unfold. One of the things
that you are doing in Avatar is looking at the way the world has
unfolded, and determining what the beliefs must have been in
mass consciousness that resulted in those experiences.

It has been a very long time since anyone has managed anything
close to this perspective on the progress of civilization. And
we've only begun!

And what a change we can make in mass consciousness. Prior to
the Avatar materials, the major belief in mass consciousness was
that "The only way man would ever transform into a spiritual
being would be through some kind of disaster." As a result, you
had all sorts of Armageddons, floods, earthquakes, the planet
tipping over, the poles shifting, continents rising, continents
falling. The whole idea being that in order to reach some higher
state of consciousness one had to experience some terrible
disaster or go through some terrific suffering. And this has
basically been the mass consciousness belief connected with any
kind of spirituality up to the present day; that in order to
become a spiritual being you had to walk a very narrow path, be
very good, and suffer for a long period of time--and hopefully--
maybe if, _if_ everything went well, in a lifetime you could
accomplish some sort of spiritual level or spiritual attainment.
This was basically the belief of mass consciousness. _NOT ANY
MORE!_

Well, you see how Avatar flies right into the teeth of that.
We're actually looking at a process now that takes a person from
a material meat-density body to a very high level of spiritual
beingness, to an unlimited being. It's no longer a belief that
we've got to suffer and do this for 50 years and go through all
of this in order to arrive at some nirvana. So this may test
your credibility, in which case we'll just handle your beliefs
on it later, but Avatar is making an effect in mass
consciousness that makes the idea of a planetary disaster no
longer necessary. We don't have to have earthquakes, floods,
volcanos and tip the planet over to achieve planetary
transformation. It's no longer a necessary event because we are
starting to work into that area of mass consciousness. You are
changing a lot more than your personal life. The implication of
what's going on here, what's occurring, probably goes right
through the ceiling of your credibility. But believe me, it's
going to become real as you play more with this material.

(Applause)

OK? That's a little off the point of what we're going to talk
about, but that is our new perspective on things. Nothing
handles limitations faster than the creation handling procedure
in Avatar. You can shovel limitations off by the dump truck
load. You locate a limitation, you label it, you disassociate
from it, you discreate it, is that fast enough? Oh, but there's
go to be a lot of suffering, right? Got to be a lot of
preparation, right? You got to prove to yourself a lot of times
that you're not actually limited, right? Label those beliefs.
Recognize they're not you. Recognize you're only creating what
you're experiencing. You don't need to create the belief.
Thereafter you don't need to experience what the belief brought
about. Just unbelievable. You can produce a no limit being with
the Avatar materials.

Limits are usually in the form of "I can't." As a person becomes
more sophisticated and recognizes that "I can't" isn't really
very acceptable; it's sort of like saying "I ain't." "Oh, don't
say I can't." He covers it up. He gets real clever about it, he
says "Well, I'll try" which is implying that he can't, or "I'll
do my best" which is implying again that he can't. Or "I'll take
a crack at it," "give it my best shot," "do your best, that's
all anybody can ask, right?" All of these limiting beliefs that
they pile up have for their basis "I can't."

You'll find somebody coming along asserting something very
strongly. But under this assertion is the belief that he can't
do what he's asserting. He wouldn't need to assert it so
strongly if he really believed he could do it. And all of this
is a case of one creating against oneself, because guess who
created the limitation. Guess who's now creating the idea that
the limitation doesn't exist. Guess who's fighting himself.

Now, remember I told you that when we got a little bit of
experience with this Avatar material we'd complicate it? Ah,
well, it's really not complicated but what we're getting into
now is a model where two people can sit down, one of them being
a guide, one of them agreeing to take a look at his or her
beliefs, and together they can dig things up. I'm certainly not
saying that this can't be done solo, but a guide makes it more
fun for one thing, and the second thing is that the guide is
able to spot some things which the person may be so identified
with that he can't see himself. The guide finds out what the
person is experiencing and then deduces what the beliefs must be
that the person is holding that would cause the person to
experience that.

The fundamental principle involved is that a person is going to
experience what he believes, not vice-versa; so if a person
comes in and says "I can't fly by flapping my arms," what do you
know? At some level he believes that he can't fly by flapping
his arms.

Now, whether he can stay in a body and re-achieve the level of
decision which will allow him to handle that limitation, I don't
know. I don't want to add any limitations. We're masters at
limitations. So, back to this team effort of handling the
creation handling procedure.

Basically, what the guide is looking for is something that the
person's sitting in, that he's experiencing but that he doesn't
recognize as his own beliefs. Those beliefs that you hold
closest to you, they tend to be invisible; and if you approach
them, you go "wh, wh, but that's true! That's true! Hey, like,
you know, that's, that's true!" Of course it is! You know! It's
true if you believe it. And those beliefs you believe in most
strongly are the ones you have the most evidence for.

(Audience: You bet!)

But still, the evidence appeared after the belief, not prior to
the belief. So you can sort this backwards always, and find out
what must that guy have believed in order to have experienced
that!

Once in awhile something will hang up on the discreate step. It
doesn't seem to be discreating. That's where a guide comes in
handy because, the guide observes what the experience is, what's
happening, and from that he figures out what the belief is. For
instance, is there a belief that you can't get rid of that? You
see, it just doubles back on itself.

Also, limiting beliefs take several forms. One of them is just
the straight out "I can't." That's an easy one. Another is "I
can, but there are all these things that have to occur first."
It's like a conditional limiting belief. "Well, sure, I can play
the harmonica, but I'm gonna need to take lessons, practice,
etc."

And then there's another limiting belief that's based on this
ideal standard that you come up with. And until you reach that
standard of perfection, you feel that you can't play the
harmonica. Otherwise you say "Well, I can't play the harmonica"
and you have this view of somebody who is the most incredible
harmonica player in the whole world and you compare yourself to
him and you say "See, there's evidence, I can't play the
harmonica." But you see, the belief underlying that is that he
is the best harmonica player in the world.

(Joe: Could there be like a generalization underneath that, like
"I can't do something as well as someone else so therefore I'm
not proficient at it?" In other words, take it down from playing
harmonicas and make it really basic.)

Yep, certainly can. You can handle a limiting belief at a lot of
different levels. At whatever level you actually believe you can
handle it at. You could handle all your limiting beliefs by just
saying "I believe I have limitations!" Identify with it, label
it, disassociate with it.

(Audience: That would be the pinnacle.)
Yeah.

(Miken: So it wouldn't matter if the belief came from the mass
consciousness or from your own individual consciousness, you
know what I mean?)

Only in that you're going to have to identify with the belief.
And if the belief is in mass consciousness, then you are going
to have to assume the viewpoint of mass consciousness. You're
going to have to take responsibility for a lot of beings. See, a
lot depends on whether or not you will be limited by your belief
of what's possible. You should test first and if it doesn't
work, check for a limiting belief.

If you take a fear apart, at the bottom will be limiting
beliefs. Take a worry apart. At the bottom of every worry are
limiting beliefs. Again, often there's a belief of how you have
to be in order to do what you have to do, like a prerequisite
belief.

Others-a lot of "I'm going to become" beliefs. When somebody
says "I'm going to become something," a good guide will
recognize right away that they believe they are not that thing
right now. When in fact they are every expression of reality
simultaneously. And they've just chosen to focus on not being
that and then again they're getting into this belief that they
have to go through a certain procedure in order to arrive at
that .... You could just imagine that you've already gone
through the procedure.

Basically, a guide is going to uncover these core beliefs and
expose them. It's a cooperative effort. No rules other than get
along. If there's any difficulty, the guide should spot the
difficulty as a belief or a thought, get it labeled,
disassociated from; in other words, the process handles the
process.

The guide can get very skillful. A question that a guide can ask
are "What effort do you believe is necessary for you to be able
to do that?" This starts uncovering the limiting beliefs. The
guide can run the person through the steps if he wants, gently
saying "OK, experience it, expand to the outside of that idea,
label it without judgment," and so on. But what he is really
doing is translating the reality the person is experiencing into
the belief the person must be holding to experience that
reality. Then getting the person to identify and experience the
belief, define it, label it, disassociate from it, and discreate
it. It's very neat. Would you like some examples of it?

(Audience: Yeah.)

All right, let's see. M, would you come right up here and sit
right there?

(M: Sure.)

All right. What skill or ability would you like to be better at?

(M: Ahm. Be a better mother.)

Being a better mother. Do you have any limiting beliefs on being
a better mother?

(M: Yeah. I think like I've heard things such as you have to be
very careful in raising a child or he'll grow up to be a mass
murderer.)

Would you really experience that belief for me ... how careful
you have to be, if you don't want to produce a mass murderer.
Expand right to the outside of that belief. Label it.
Effortlessly recognize "This is not-I," permit it to discreate.

(M: Did you see that fall right off in front of my face?
Schoom!)

Got any other limiting beliefs?

(M: Ah, yes, that some people on the planet aren't ready for
spiritual enlightenment.)

That has to do with being a better mother?

(M: No, do you want one, another one on being a better mother?)

Yes, let's handle that.

(M: Now I don't know if I have anything on better mother or
not.)

Do you have any fears about being a mother?

(M: Yeah, I want to make sure I do everything right so she does
expand, and be safe . . .)

With loving tolerance, really experience that idea. that you
want to do everything right.

(M: That's a good thing to do "with loving tolerance.")

Pushing against it really doesn't help.

(M: No, it doesn't, does it?)

Really experience that you're wanting to do everything right.

(M: OK.)

Expand right to the outermost limits of that idea, label it. Now
effortlessly recognize "this is not-I."

(M: This is not-I.)

Good, now permit it to discreate.

(M: It feels like it just kinda fell like a ... pop! That was
neat!)

Any worries about being a good mother?

(M: Really looking . . . yeah, I guess I would have a worry
that I ... Yeah! As a matter of fact, I don't want her to go
through a harmful life. To leam hard things, or at least I hope
that I'll be able to help her during those times.)

Good. Really experience that belief. (pause) Expand to the
outside perimeter of it. (pause) Label that and effortlessly
recognize this is not-I.

(M: This is not-I.)

Permit it to discreate.

(M: Right.)

Good.

(M: I just feel all this charge blowing off my face.)

OK. Now let's take up this idea of what a good mother would be.

(M: That's a good one all right)

What would a good mother be?

(M: A good mom would be somebody who watches their child grow,
and can guide them, and say the right thing at the right time
and teach them things.)

How about a bad mother?

(M: A bad mom would do the opposite of all those. Not teach the
child things, set a bad example, drink, swear ...)

OK. With loving tolerance, experience being both a good mom and
a bad mom.

(M: OK.)

Expand right to the outside of that idea.

Label it, recognize this is not-I.

(M: This is not-I.)

Permit it to discreate.

(M: It kinda goes kerplop on all sides of me, it's just . . .
gone.)

How are you doing?

(M: I'm doing great. I'm doing wonderful!)

Now, how about this thing about the world not being ready for
spiritual enlightenment?

(M: Oh, that's shit! That is not-I)

Anything you feel you have to do to be a good mother?

(M: Actually, I kinda . . . the viewpoint that I have now,
is looking from the outside at her and being able to be
tolerant, knowing she is not-I, too. Letting her experience
her experiences.)

Thank you.

(M: Yeah. Thank you.)

Hello L. Any skills or abilities you'd like to be able to do
better?

(L: Write.)

Write? Do you have any limiting beliefs about writing?

(L: I believe you have to know the right things to say.)

OK. With loving tolerance, experience that you really have to
know the right things to say in order to be a writer, right?
Expand right to the outside of that idea.

Label it.

Effortlessly recognize, this is not-I. Discreate.

(L: Good. It was easy . . .)

Do you have any other limiting beliefs about writing?

(L: It's hard.)

That it's hard. OK. Really experience that it's hard to write.

With loving tolerance, expand right to the outside of that
idea . . . label it . . . recognize effortlessly, this is not-I.

(L: This is not-I.)

Not I?

(L: Nope.)

Discreate.

(L: OK.)

Any other limiting beliefs about writing?

(L: No. I can do whatever I want.)

Anything you feel you have to do to write?

(L: Make it understandable.)

Is that difficult?

(L: Yeah. It depends upon the person. I can make it
understandable to me. It's just difficult to make sure it
comes across.)

OK, really experience that . . . expand right to the outside
limit of this idea . . . put a label on it . . . effortlessly
recognize, this is not-I.

(L: OK.)

Permit it to discreate.

(L: There's something from the mass consciousness, you know,
when you communicate or anyone communicates, it's understood.)

Good. What should you do to write?

(L: Write whatever comes out and know it's right.)

OK. Have any limitations on that?

(L: Nope, just do it.)

Any effort in doing that?

(L: The only effort I can see will be slowing the hand to write
it down.)

Any fears about it?

(L- They're gone. Thank you.)

Thank you.

                           *  *  *


Get the idea?

(Audience: Yeah!)

Want to do one more?

(Audience: Sure!)

Go for a hard skill. Go for a real tough skill. What would you
really like to do?

(M: To be able to communicate in any situation under any
circumstances. You know, having the right thing come
out, just have that skill.)

Do you have any limiting beliefs that you can do that?

(M; You have to know enough to do that.)

Oh. Good.

(M: You have to be like Harry Palmer.)

OK. With loving tolerance, identify with the idea that you've
got to know a lot in order to make things come out alright.

Expand right to the limits of that idea.

(M: That's a big idea!)

OK.

Put a label on it.

Effortlessly recognize, this is not-I.

Permit it to discreate.

(M: It's like rain. It just falls away.)

Good. Well, what would you have to do to communicate
anything you wanted any time?

(M: You'd have to be able to be there comfortably, your
confront would have to be impeccable.)

Get that idea that your confront would have to be
impeccable. You'd really have to be there comfortably.

(M: OK.)

Expand to the very outside limits of that idea.

(M: All right.)

Label it. Permit it to discreate.

(M: OK.)

All right. Now what would you have to do to communicate?

(M: I would have to like the person I'm talking to. I
would have to be tolerant of any viewpoint.)

Really identify and experience that belief; "That you would
have to like the person you were talking to."

(M: Identifying with it; it just keeps going.)

Good. Expand right to the outside limits of that idea.

(M: OK.)

Label it. Effortlessly recognize, this is not-I.

(M: This is not-I)

Good. Discreate it.

(M: It's gone.)

Do you have any other ideas of what you'd have to do to
be able to communicate?

(M: Yeah. They'd have to like me.)

Really identify with that belief; "That they'd have to like
me." Feel what it feels like to have that belief.

(M: OK. All right.)

Expand to the outermost limits of that belief.

(M: All right.)

Label it.

Effortlessly recognize, this is not-I.

(M: This is not-I.)

Permit it to discreate.

(M: All right.)

OK. Now one other thing.

(M: I bet I could communicate anywhere I want to
communicate.)

Well, I'm going to ask what other conditions have to be met
here in order to really communicate.

(M: Let's see, I'd probably have to take all these courses.
There'd be Dale Carnegie, and several public speaking
engagements, and just a whole lot of stuff that you have to
do.)

Yeah, good. OK. Well, really identify and experience that
there's a lot of stuff that you have to do to communicate.

(M: Yeah.)

Expand right to the outermost limits of that idea.

(M: All right.)

Label it.

Effortlessly recognize this is not-I.

(M: This is not-I.)

Permit it to discreate.

(M: All right.)

Now, what other conditions have to be met for your to
communicate?

(M: Let's see, oh, I'd have to look real nice, the body has
to be healthy, in good condition.)

OK, really experience this idea that you have to look real
nice.

Expand right to the outermost limits of that idea.

(M: Yeah, that one goes the length of my body. All right)

Put a label on it.

Recognize this is not-I.

(M: All right.)

Permit it to discreate.

(M: It's gone alright.)

Good. What other conditions do we have to handle in
order for you to communicate real well?

(M: That's all.)

That's all?

(M: I can do anything I want to do.)

You're right.

(M: That is, that's incredible. I just feel, there's all this
energy that's pouring off me.)

Good.

(M: That's great!)

Thank you.

                           *  *  *



 It's unlimited as to how you apply it. Any skill you want, if
you don't have it, there must be some belief intervening between
you and acquiring that skill. You can handle those beliefs.
Then, if you believe that you have to believe that you have the
skill, handle that one too.

It folds back and forth on itself. I run into people who believe
they have to make a certain affirmation in order to have a
certain ability. That's a limiting belief. Handle anything you
find. Do you want psychic skills, extrasensory abilities, to
communicate with other dimensions, perceive other realities,
communicate with the mass consciousness? These things are all
impossible, right? They used to be! OK. Thank you very much.

[3] LIMITATIONS HANDLING



---------------------------------
Definitions:

Limitation: a belief or idea
that a person has created that
restricts the scope of his
accomplishments.

Doubt: a wavering in belief; or
lack of conviction.

Creature: Consciousness
choosing to exist as a particular
creation.
---------------------------------



In simple terms, you can choose to believe that you have
certain limitations as to what you may experience. This is how
creation is accomplished. (With no limitations, consciousness
experiences all that is.) A _creature_ existing within an
overall creation, will be subject to the foundation beliefs that
created the overall creation.

This may limit a creature as to what he may create within
that creation or reality. However, he will always have the
choice of becoming the _creator_ of the reality.

Some creatures who wish to create miracles for others (by
breaking through or transcending accepted limitations) _have yet
to recognize that the other people are only the ideas they have
created of THEMSELVES_. (Imagining someone seeing the miracle is
part of the miracle.) If they wish to experience creating
miracles for crowds of people, they need only create a reality
containing the idea of crowds of people and perform their
miracles. It can be a satisfying exercise!

As one progresses through the Avatar materials, he becomes
less and less a creature (existing as creation) and more and
more a creator (source of creation). As a creator he can
identify his beliefs, experience them, define them, label them
and discreate them--which changes the reality he then
experiences. He may also create new beliefs which will permit
him to experience new realities.

Where one is experiencing limitations that are not preferred,
he may shift his viewpoint to the creator of the reality and
identify the beliefs that are responsible for the limitations he
is experiencing.

For example, someone who doubts his or her ability to write
will be found experiencing reality created by the belief, "I
don't know if I can write or not". If he prefers not to
experience that reality, he can shift into the _creator mode_
and change his beliefs.

He may also have associated limiting beliefs about what he
must do to write, the reasons why he writes, and what writing
should look like. He may find that experiencing all of the
conditions that he believes necessary to write is so exhausting
that he has no energy left with which to write.

As an Avatar, if he prefers not to experience these
limitations, he can identify each belief that is responsible for
creating the limitation and discreate it! Voila! He may then
experience writing.


_By inspecting the limitations one is experiencing in any
endeavor, one can locate the beliefs responsible for the
experience of those limitations and change them._


The only beliefs that a person will not immediately change
are the beliefs he believes serve him. When the beliefs that his
limitations serve him are inspected, he may or may not choose to
change them.

A workable understanding of the above, the Creation
Handling Procedure and the Creation Exercises, allows the Avatar
to focus upon the reality he or she chooses to experience.

Either solo or as a team effort, each limiting belief that a
person has created on his own abilities can be identified,
experienced, defined, labeled, disassociated from and
discreated.

Any belief that performance or reality must meet certain
standards can be identified, experienced, defined, labeled,
disassociated from and discreated.

Any belief that one has that "It just can't be this easy"
should be identified, lovingly experienced, defined, labeled,
disassociated from and discreated.

It is this easy!




PROCEDURE


Select a quiet, comfortable and relaxing location.

In your personal folder you will find a _Limitations
Worksheet_ that contains a _suggested_ list of limitations you
may have encountered in your life. Use this list as a starting
point to locate limitations which you no longer prefer to
experience.

Since one only experiences a limitation after _"desiring to
and not being able,"_ the following step 1 will be used.


1.    _Identity with and experience._

    _"Feel what it feels like to want to _(limitation)_ and
    not be able to _(same limitation)_ ._"


2.    _Define_ the limitation by expanding your awareness to
    the outermost limits of the entire creation.


3.    _Label without Judgment_ the overall form. A
    viewpoint shift should occur.


4.    _Disassociate from_ the creation by addressing it with:
    This is not-I. This is _my_ creation."


5.    _Discreate_. Stop creating it. Turn off the "creating
    energy" to it.


Repeat steps 1-5 until you are satisfied that you have
handled any limitation you do not wish to experience.




RE-CREATION OF ABILITY


6. When you are ready to create the ability you desire,
construct a primary origination(s) that expresses that
ability (e.g., I can . . . ). Using the Creation
Exercise from Section II, create your new ability as a
reality. In some cases the ability may manifest as
fully achieved, in other cases it may manifest as a
path to acquiring the ability. In either case,
recognize that any doubt you have is a _secondary
origination_. Handle the secondary with steps 1-5 of
the Creation Handling Procedure and continue to
the primary origination until it creates the ability or
the opportunity to acquire the ability. This process
may take from a few minutes to several hours.

--------------------------------------------------------





[4] AVATAR IDENTITY HANDLING

(Reference: Creativism:
Belief and Experience, Section I)



A belief is a specialized thought-form that consciousness
creates within the creation it is experiencing.

Consciousness may identify with this belief thought-form in
order to specifically locate itself within the overall creation
and to have a specific focus from which to experience the
overall creation. This is the idea of _self_ existing within
creation.

This _self_ is a facet of consciousness that can be "broken off"
and identified as something. Many may exist in any overall
creation, allowing consciousness to experience the creation from
many different focuses.

Consciousness, in identifying with many of these belief
thought-forms within the overall creation, creates the illusion
of separate selves, separate identities. Each self possessing a
different viewpoint (filtering belief) of the overall creation
and of all other selves.

Following the principle "As above, so below," each separate
belief thought-form (self) has the ability to create and
identify with more belief thought-forms within the overall
creation than were previously itself. It now experiences the
overall creation (previous self) from many different viewpoints,
through many different filtering beliefs called self-images or
_identities._

The following analogy, to some degree, will serve to aid
_intellectual understanding_.

_Sphere containing spheres which contain spheres._

Many self-image ideas exist within that idea of self that we are
being. The self-image ideas we identify with determine how we
will view ourselves and what we will experience. If we identify
with the self-image of being a victim, we will view ourselves as
victims and experience all sorts of tragic evidence to support
our belief. If we identify with the self-image of being unable
to establish a relationship, we will view ourselves as a loner
and evidence of loneliness will abound. If we ... do you get the
point?



---------------------------------
Definitions:

Belief: the state of believing; a
conviction or acceptance that
certain things are true or real.

Limit: the point, line, or edge
where something ends or must
end; boundary or border beyond
which something ceases to be or
to be possible.
---------------------------------



When we can view ourselves as containing all self-images
imaginable and identifying equally and without judgment with all
of them, we will experience the state of Avatar and be attracted
to other Avatars in the continuing process of the re-integration
of consciousness.

To continue our analogy, _when one ceases to create different
spheres to exist as, one integrates and becomes the overall
sphere that was creating._

When you have handled certain self-images which you have
created, but would rather not experience, you will no longer
project them on other portions of consciousness or feel the
desire to view them as separate. Manifestations of consciousness
are manifestations of consciousness! As your acceptance and love
grows, the idea of re-integration will acquire a new meaning.
(It's hard to be too close to those you dearly love.)

The CREATION HANDLING PROCEDURE fully applies.




PROCEDURE


Select a quiet, comfortable and relaxed space.
Make a brief list for each of the following:

The names of people who

        A. You dislike
        B. You feel critical of
        C  You feel judgmental toward
        D. You fear
        E. You pity
        F. You don't want anything to do with
        G. You feel are unsupportive of you
        H. You consider evil
        I. You consider selfish
        J. You consider especially negative
        K. You do not fully accept
        L. You could never love again

(Adopt a progressive approach for your Identity handling. To
begin, select the identities on your personal list that are
least emotionally charged. When you have discreated them, work
up to the more heavily charged identities.)


1. Select a name from your list and _identity with_ the _idea_
you have of that person. Feel as you believe they feel. When you
have identified successfully, you will begin to recognize the
belief as something you have resisted being.

2. _Define_ the identity by expanding your awareness in every
dimension until you contact the unknown (space) that encloses
the identity.

3. _Label without Judgment_ the identity. A viewpoint shift
should occur.

4. _Disassociate from_ the identity by addressing it with: "This
is not- _(identity)_, this is _my_ creation."

5. _Discreate_. Stop creating the identity. Turn off the
"creating energy" to that creation.

Repeat steps 1-5 on the same identity or any other identities
you select until neither that nor any other identity affects
your view of the portion of consciousness that was identified
with them. Recognize the identity as your own creation, as a
manifestation of consciousness, that you chose (past tense) to
experience, to resist experiencing or to explore.

In your personal folder you will find a list of generalized
identities. Select any that you feel resistance toward and do
steps 1-5 on them.

When you have achieved a satisfactory result, write up a
de-brief on what you have experienced/recognized on the rundown.




RE-CREATION STEP
(Optional)


6. When you are ready, create an idea of an identity that you
choose to have. Construct a primary origination(s) that
expresses that creation. Using the Creation Exercise from
Section II, create your new identity as a reality. Recognize
that any self-image that shows up other than the one you
wish to create is a _secondary origination_. Handle the
secondary with steps 1-5 above and continue the primary
origination until it creates the reality you prefer. This
process may take anywhere from a few minutes to several
hours. When your new identity creates automatically, you
have achieved success.

[5] PERSISTENT MASS HANDLING

(Revised and reissued by Star's Edge International 3/15/92
to update and replace "Persistent Mass Handling" lecture
transcript in current Avatar Course Section III)



Good morning!

Before I go back to California, I want to tell you about this
latest research.

It's pretty hot stuff.

Some of what you have run into creations that don't appear to
discreate. Somebody dubbed them persistent masses, and that's
probably as good a label as any.

If you examine this persistent mass phenomenon, you'll find a
compact cluster of creations that hang around and refuse to be
turned off. The creations actually reinforce each other. They
act like backup energy sources that sustain a creation even when
you turn the creating energy off--something like the emergency
lights that you see around exits and stairwells that come on
when the power fails.

So, I have been studying this, and it finally unraveled a bit
today. I haven't had time to organize it yet, so I'll give you
what I know in bits and pieces and we'll clean it up later.

First, a persistent mass is a resisted experience that's
bordered by an unknown. Someone grew tired of consciously
resisting something, so they put it on automatic and wrapped it
with an unknown. And now, it's back!

Second, every creation is bordered, either by knowns or
unknowns. Unknowns are bordered by knowns and knowns are
bordered by unknowns.

So, you decide to create a belief. The belief acts as a filter
and extracts from the universe a certain energy that you
experience as the fulfillment of that belief. OK so far?

Later on, because of some interaction with the world or
another, you decide that you'd rather not experience that energy
anymore. But, instead of discreating the belief that is
filtering that energy out of the universe, you disown it and
deny that you created it. You say, and this is the key, "I don't
know anything about that," or "I don't know what this is."

That belief--I don't know--creates an unknown around the
first belief and now you have a persistent mass. If the second
belief has some kind of timeless phrase in it like, "never,"
"forever," "all eternity," "always," "this is it," "don't ever,"
it creates a real persistence for the first belief. '

Another way of making the unknown persist is to connect it
with some sort of body function so that it continually creates.
"Every time I think about it," "Every time I have sex," "Every
time I eat," "I keep thinking about this every time I" ...and
you've hooked up a function that continues in time with the
automatic creation of this belief that denies knowledge of the
original belief.

And you push it off someplace, since you don't believe you
created it. Unconsciousness is not something that happens to
you; it's something you create. If you can't experience
something as source, there's no danger that you'll discreate it.
That's a persistent mass. It's a neat trick. Probably the whole
physical universe is nothing more than a persistent mass. It's
also a good way to divide yourself up into many entities, create
races and plant and animal kingdoms. If you believe the creation
is separate from you, it doesn't take any great leap of faith to
believe that the consciousness in that creation must be separate
from you as well.

Well, let me give you some ideas of this belief- created
unknown. When you put your attention on a persistent mass, you
actually contact this belief that the creation is unknown--first
thing. "What is this?" you say, pretending all the while that
someone else is creating it.

Sometimes it's layered in unknowns. You've been busy. You've
attempted to handle this before, and what you experienced at
that earlier time was that you didn't know. So now you have a
lot of evidence built up on it that proves you don't know what
it is. (laughter)

But the basic unknown on it is your desire not to know.

"I never know what this is."

"I can't ever seem to get it."

"I can't figure it out."

"I try and try and it never goes away."

"It's just there, I don't know."

"I've worked on that sucker forever and it just doesn't go away.

"It always comes back."

These timeless beliefs reinforce the unknowns of the creation.
They keep this creation from being contacted and
experienced--which is exactly what your intention was when you
upholstered it with the first unknown.

"I just can't believe...*

"It always seems sort of..."

Always? Can't? You want to learn to look for these words.

"Maybe I don't want to get rid of it."

And now you can create another layer of unknown on the first
unknown. Second layer--"I don't know if I want to get rid of it
or not." Layers of unknowns, usually with wrong conclusions
sandwiched in between. Things like: "I've tried everything."
"Well, it's always there when I look." And the king of all wrong
conclusions, "It's not mine!"

Always?

"Every time I bend over, it's there."

"Every time I wake up, it's there."

"Every time I go to sleep, it's there."

"Every time I eat, it's there."

See how clever we can get in putting these unknowns around
something and structuring them so they go on being created
forever?

So you forget that you chose to create this belief to experience
something, and now the belief is bordered by more beliefs about
its being unknown. Every time you try to penetrate this
persistent mass creation, you hit this timeless unknown about
it. Where did it come from? Who created it? God, probably,
(laughter)

God, certainly! But now God is hiding in the universe going,
"Who could possibly have created this?" God? He must be very
powerful...and good. You heathens better worship me, er, I mean,
God.

Have we got a little ego involved here? I don't know!
(laughter)

So you experience the belief that you don't know. But did you
ever consider that maybe you also created the belief that you
didn't know? Naaa! (Laughter)

Um hm. I am going to tell you how to get rid of persistent
masses, (audience cheers)

It's simplicity in itself, it really is. Most of you have
already guessed it.

You discreate the unknown first!

There's a resisted experience within the persistent mass. The
experience is resisted through a misunderstanding on your part
that you originally chose to experience it. That was the role.
That's the game you wanted to play. (Harry joking: "Yep, I guess
I did, but I sure don't remember it.")

Now, it doesn't matter what the resisted experience is; it could
be a murder but probably it's something milder. Why would you
create it in the first place? Because identity-less awareness
can play any games without judgment.

Now how long does it take you to experience something? The
time factor enters into experience only when you're trying to
evaluate the experience or make a judgment on the experience.
That's what enters the time factor into experience. Otherwise,
everything is experienced as right now, instantly.

When you are handling a persistent mass, you need to be
aware that the experience which was resisted became resisted
because a negative judgment was associated with it. And you're
going to run into that when you start handling it. Realize that
it's just another layer of belief built up around this
"orphaned" creation.

How to handle it? What you want to do first is find all the
beliefs that keep it unknown. You just identify whatever the
belief is that keeps the unknown around the mass, and experience
it (i.e., Feel what it feels like to puzzle over...). These
unknown beliefs come up as soon as you put your attention on the
mass.

Now there may be a lot of layers to the thing. Just experience
and discreate them one at a time: first an unknown and then a
conclusion about the unknown, and then another unknown and then
another conclusion, etc. At the core you will find a resisted
experience, but there is a hidden side to this resisted
experience. The hidden side to the resisted experience is this;
before it was resisted, it was desired! That's the core of a
persistent mass. The desire and resist are so antithetical to
each other that they create separate realities.

One of the realities is one you won't want to experience. And
that's the heart of the persistent mass.

So you find that experience and discreate the judgment on it
and then experience it, along with the resistance, and the whole
thing will discreate like any other creation.

Now, some of the creations may have been co-creations with
others. Of course, others are persistent masses as well. Oh, yes
you are! (laughter)

Don't worry, nobody would ever want to experience all of us!

Our conclusions about individuality are safe--at least for the
time being.

If you run into a persistent creation with another "individual,"
it will require that you experience and discreate your judgment
on that individual, and then view the situation as the source of
every viewpoint involved. I told you this was hot stuff!

Occasionally you'll run into a case where you'll have a number
of these persistent masses compacted together. I guess if you're
creating experiences that you don't want to experience, you
might as well stick 'em all together. Then you've got a cluster
of persistent masses. Sometimes you'll have little clusters of
masses, and you will handle part of it and get a change, but
there'll still be something there. Well, you've made some
progress. Just recognize there's still more there.

Rather than resisting the fact that you don't know, or that you
haven't found out what it is, just realize how exciting the
progress you're making is. You can experience an unknown. It's
exciting to experience an unknown. We're wrapped in one, you
know?

When you clean up all of the unknowns, you are going to
contact the unknown that is around this idea that you have of
yourself. Certainly do not stop there. That's just another
unknown to handle.

As an Avatar, you want to be responsible for creating yourself,
not just for getting to a point where you can live with
yourself. You're Creators. You're not adjusters.

Define, label, disassociate, discreate, until you're right back
at the level of pure awareness, without any persistent masses.
It's not necessarily going to happen instantly,
overnight--though it may if you expect it to. (Laughter)

Sometimes you have to peel layers off. Some people have a lot
more confront on unknowns than others. An unknown motivates
some people to create--that's where rumor and gossip starts.
It's not the way to achieve Avatar.

Stop creating; you're overwriting yourself. Start experiencing
until the tablet is blank again. (Applause)

Gee, thanks. Since you are so nice, I'll give you one more
little thing we've been working on. It's called a worm. A worm
is a computer hack word that refers to a sub-program, or a
sub-routine, that's contained in certain computer programs.
Every time the computer program goes on line, the worm makes a
little progress in whatever it's been programmed to do. Some
worms eat away at and eventually destroy the program. They're
parasitic worms. Other worms operate so that each time you turn
the program on, they recalculate how long since you last used
the program. They're monitor worms. The principle behind a worm
is that it's connected with some function of the main program so
it works automatically.

Now if you want to create something, create a parasitic worm
and stick it on one of your persistent masses. The worm would be
a belief that the mass is going to unravel, resolve, disappear.
Just stick that belief on the mass and connect it with your
breathing. Every time you take a breath, the worm makes a little
progress on the persistent mass.

It's your universe. Make it work for you. You're the creator.
You can create stuff like that in your universe.

All right? Any questions?

Q: Harry, could you approach persistent mass with the idea
that you just love it? And if you didn't love it, you just love
it some more and roll around in it like a dog in a dead
woodchuck and stuff? (laughter)

The very idea of the word persistent means, "I don't like it."
But, yeah, I believe that if you could love it enough that it
would just fling you right through the unknown that surrounded
it. And you'd be in it just like that. Love allows forgiveness,
and forgiveness takes off judgment. I think that would be a key.
It's probably why love is such a valuable tool.

Q: What if a person believes he can't get rid of something?

There are black worms and white worms. That's a black worm. The
white worm is, you can get rid of it. Good worms and bad worms.
Worm wars! (laughter) You all have a champion worm that is
handling everything that comes up, every time you breathe. A
guardian angel if you will.

[6] PERSISTENT MASS HANDLING

(Revised and reissued by Star's Edge International 3/15/92
to update and replace "Persistent Mass Handling" in current
Avatar Course Section III)



--------------------------------------
Definitions:

Mass n.: 1. a quantity of matter
forming a body of indefinite shape and
size.  2. an unidentified creation.

To Persist: to remain unchanged or
fixed in a specified character,
condition or position; to be insistent
upon repetition.

To resist: to withstand the force of; to
exert oneself to counteract or defeat;
to exert force in opposition to; _to
desire not to_.

Disown vt.: to refuse to acknowledge as
one's own.
---------------------------------------



        "_Resisting a creation means that you will not
        willingly own, experience or recognize yourself
        as the source of the creation._"



A persistent mass is a creation that is continuously created by
"creating energy" from a source which you feel you have no
control over. It can be an obsession, a neurosis, a pain, a
fixed condition, an antagonist, a disease--literally any
perception whose duration is greater than now.




The Anatomy of a Persistent Mass


Choosing to resist the experience of something that one has
chosen to experience (by his or her creation of belief) creates
the effect of suffering, of being swept along, of being out of
control. Time begins. One creates against oneself. Feeling is
replaced by thinking,




How to Create a Persistent Mass


If, instead of experiencing a creation and recognizing yourself
as independent of the creation--as the source of the primary
that is creating it--you disown the creation and resist it by
creating responses to it, you will create a persistent mass.

In the interval between creating the creation and creating
against the creation (resisting), there is a shift in the
viewpoint of the creator. This shift of viewpoint occurs across
an unknown and creates the appearance that the old viewpoint and
the new viewpoint are separate.

A persistent mass is persisting because, identified with the
new viewpoint, you are attempting to create away a
definition--rather than experiencing it and discrcating it. The
persistent mass feeds off your resistance, reflecting it back to
you as perception.

The core resistance was a moment containing painful emotions
(grief, fear, anger) and/or sudden pain and trauma severe enough
to cause you to respond by shifting your viewpoint.




The Denial Zone


The interval over which the shift in viewpoint occurs is an area
of unknowness that is placed between the viewpoints to keep them
separate, i.e., "I never want this to happen again."



----------------------------------------
A reality is what a viewpoint views,
directs attention to.

A persistent mass is a reality that does
not discreate on the CHP and appears
not to be your creation--at least not
the creation of the viewpoint you
currently occupy.

Within the Avatar framework, "a
desire" means a connection that is
created between two realities of
different energy potential.
----------------------------------------




The Core Creation


To discreate a persistent mass, you must discover and
experience the creation at the core of the persistent mass that
was disowned--disowned in the confusion of shifting viewpoints.

This core creation appears to be a source, but it is really only
a reflector. It is like a moon that reflects the light radiated
by the sun, only this moon reflects resistance radiated by you.
And your own resistance, reflected back to you, is interpreted
into the perception you have of the persistent mass--pain,
anger, illness, fixed condition, etc. The core of the persistent
mass appears to be the source of the perception. It's not. The
source of the perception is you, but you do not recognize the
reflection of your own resistance.

A persistent mass will always be some interpretation of
reflected resistance.

If the persistent mass is experienced at any level prior to its
core resisted creation, it fails to discreate, or if appearing
discreated, it will mysteriously return. If you experience only
your current resistance to the persistent mass or experience
only a few layers of unknowns and wrong conclusions about it,
but fail to discover and experience the original disowned
creation at its core, the persistent mass will reappear as a
reflecting body the next time something unpleasant happens and
you radiate resistance.




Discovering the Core Creation


_Resistance is the path that leads to the core of the persistent
mass_. Experience the resistance you feel toward the persistent
mass (pain, obsession, fixed condition, etc.) and ride its
reflection like a wave, steering your attention into the rising
intensity of reflection right down to the core creation. It's a
wild ride through some incredibly choppy waters, but hang on and
it will dump you in the middle of a creation that will really
set your teeth.




Persistent Masses


The person suffering from a persistent mass is entirely focused
on the reflection, imagining it as the product of an outside
source. He or she may not even suspect the existence of the
reflector.

Many people intuitively know that a persistent mass has
something to do with them, and they suspect that they somehow
create it, but they haven't yet grasped the mechanics of how it
is done. Well, now it's revealed--it's done with mirrors!

You can either stop radiating resistance so that none is
reflected--which some do successfully as long as they can avoid
conflict--or you can experience and discreate the
reflector--which is what Avatar recommends.




Instincts are Persistent Masses


The strong desires we call instincts are persistent masses
created by a viewpoint shift during a death experience. They
exist as core creations whose reflections are interpreted into
impulses toward behaviors that will result in survival. When an
instinct is resisted, one starts the ride toward its core
creation that inevitably is some form of violent death.

Obsessive behaviors, uncontrollable desires, addictions,
compulsions, fixed conditions, persistent pains, etc. are the
result of reflected resistance being interpreted into impulses
to be a certain way.

The essence of all personal reality is your interpretations
placed upon your own reflected resistance!




The Anatomy of Anger


This is a particular kind of persistent mass that has as its
core an imagined viewpoint. You imagined (created) that someone
or something held a particular viewpoint. Then you shifted from
your viewpoint that created the viewpoint for the other, and now
the other seems to be an outside source. In truth, it is not a
source, but a reflecting body. When you resist it, your own
reflected resistance is experienced as anger.




Suffering is Reflected Resistance


With a little imagination you can create scenarios of events
that, like fun house mirrors, distort the reflection of your
resistance into whatever suffering you've been enduring.

One can achieve absolutely spectacular gains (miracles) by
experiencing the impressions, thoughts, ideas, conditions, pains
or compulsions as reflected resistance and following the
intensity of the reflection down to the core creation of a
persistent mass. This is not a procedure for the faint hearted,
but once you realize that you are a no-thing and that it is only
those things which you have identified with that are doing the
resisting, you can appreciate any experience and discreate it.

When you find yourself smack in the middle of the awful,
horrible, painful event that caused the viewpoint shift, enjoy
it.




Procedure


    _0. Ensure that both student and guide understand
    and can demonstrate all the steps of this procedure.
    Do this BEFORE you begin a session either solo or
    with another._

    _When you are ready to begin (solo for the exceedingly
    brave), student and guide create a quiet, comfortable
    and relaxed space._

    1. Identify any persisting reality that you would prefer
    not to have. Ask: "_What do you want to handle?_" or,
    "_What are you suffering?_"

    2. "_Experience your resistance to the creation (pain,
    feeling, mass, desire, etc.)._"

    3. "_Expand your attention in the direction of the source
    of that resistance._"
    Spend as much time as is needed to move toward the
    source of the resistance. Many interesting things may
    happen, but don't let the student get sidetracked.

    4. "_Continue until you reach the source of the resistance
    (core creation)._"

    5. "_Now experience. Expand out and explore the
    creation. Accept any impression you get without
    response._"

    6. "_Continue to experience, expand and explore to the
    outermost limits of the creation._"

    7. "_Label it without judgment._"

    8. "_Recognize, this is not-I, this is my creation._"

    9. "_Permit it all to discreate._"

    10. Repeat as necessary. You may ask "_Would you
    like to go through it again?_"





Note: Any events, beliefs, feelings, etc. that come up while one
is following the intensity of the feeling down to the core
creation should be addressed with CHP only if they are blocking
the student from reaching the core creation.

[7] ITS ALL RIGHT TO FEEL LIKE THIS



-------------------------------
Definitions:

Creating Energy: the energy
that life generates to manifest
and/or sustain a creation.

AM: an Awakening Master.
-------------------------------



Occasionally an AM will build up such a resistance to
experiencing something that he is tempted to "create it out of
existence" rather than experience it and allow it to discreate.

Those creations (emotions, pains, feelings, etc.) that the
AM just has to get rid of--they will do anything to get rid of
them--are the same ones that the AM has the greatest resistance
to experiencing.

Any attempt that the AM makes to "create something out
of existence," even though the attempt may be successful,
consumes the AM's "creating energy." A symptom of this depleted
"creating energy" is that the AM begins to find waking life to
be exhausting and overwhelming rather than exciting and
challenging.

The beauty of the Creation Handling Procedure is that
properly done, it recovers "creating energy" for an AM rather
than consuming "creating energy." Consequently, the AM will move
from an exhausted-by-existence state to an excited-by-existence
state.

The following technique has resulted in about a 25%
increase in effectiveness of the Creation Handling Procedure. It
does this by bringing to light resistances (creations against)
that are preventing the experience of a creation. It is an
extremely powerful and effective technique that can be adapted
to a wide variety of creations.




PROCEDURE


    1. Place your attention on an emotion, feeling, upset,
    pain, sensation, dullness, numbness, voidness or
    fixed idea that is persisting as an unpleasant
    experience (in self or another identity).

    la. Primary: "It's all right to feel like this." Handle
    the secondaries (usually resistances and judgments)
    by exaggeration or CHP. Repeat until there is no
    doubt that "It is all right to feel like this."

    2. As the resistance is handled at step la, you will find
    an increased willingness to explore the experience
    it's furthermost limits. Discover, enjoy and _define_.

    3. Label it without judgment.

    4. Disassociate.

    5. Discreate.

    6. Create what you prefer.

----------------------------------------------------------------





[8] AVATAR UNIVERSE HANDLING



--------------------------------
Definitions:

Impression: the awareness one
has of something, _without_
attaching any particular meaning
to it.

A Self: the identification of
consciousness with a particular
belief or system of beliefs.

Background Reality: every
possibility coexisting equally and
simultaneously in the now.

Focused Reality: the events,
people, places, objects and
creations that _seem_ most real
relative to other events, people
places, objects and creations.
----------------------------------



A radio antenna of a particular length will oscillate in
response to vibrations of a certain amplitude or frequency,
while ignoring vibrations of different amplitude and frequency.
Change the length of the antenna by means of a tuner, and one
can selectively receive certain vibrations while ignoring
others.

Human hearing is responsive to vibrations in the 20 to
20,000 cycles per second range, while ignoring vibrations
outside of that range.

Similar ranges exist for each of the specialized organs of
human sensory perceptions. The discovery of Avatar was that
ranges exist as well for intuition, imagination and other purely
conceptual perceptions. The "organ" of conceptual perception is
the belief thought-form.

What becomes obvious from these models is that many
possible background realities may exist at the same time, with
some of them becoming relatively more real, or manifest,
depending upon our particular tuning or focus. On a very simple
level, any event, situation, or condition occurs in an infinite
number of variations simultaneously.

The "reality antenna" that causes consciousness to focus
upon one reality while ignoring other realities is the
particular belief thought-form identified with by consciousness,
i.e., _the SELF_.

Modify, or change _the SELF_, and you will change the way
in which an individual experiences reality, or more accurately
expressed, you will change the particular facet of reality upon
which the person focuses.

This provides an important key for creating those realities
which one wishes to experience--translate the experiences into
beliefs and the beliefs into self. (If you wish to experience
happiness, be a happy person. Only a fool waits for the world to
make him happy.)




Exercise: Translating experiences into beliefs.


Work out what a person would have to believe in order to
experience certain events. Repeat this for many events,
both present time and historical. Play around with this a
little. For example, what did President Kennedy (or Nixon,
Carter, or Reagan) have to believe himself to be to attract
the experiences he attracted?




Procedure: Avatar Universe Handling (Changing "selves.")


Find someone whose beliefs have brought them to
experience something they do not prefer. (IMPORTANT
NOTE: This is an action that is done _for_ a person, not _on_
or _to_ a person.)


    1. _Identify with (be) _your_ idea_ of that person and
    experience the belief they have about themselves
    that is causing them to attract the experience they do
    not prefer.

    2. Expand to the outermost limits of the belief.

    3. Label it without judgment just as it is.

    4. Disassociate from it.

    5. Allow it to discreate.


Repeat to satisfactory result. Providing you have handled
your own beliefs about a person, and your own self-imposed
limitations, you will find you can move (in a telepathic sense)
into the beliefs of the other person and assist in their
discreation. _Translating experiences into beliefs and Avatar
Universe Handling_ can also be applied to oneself.

[9] MASS-CONSCIOUSNESS HANDLING


This procedure is subject to much speculation. It is
currently an area of research for a possible future course
called WIZARDS. It is offered here for your exploration.


    Part I: Relying on your understanding of the material
    universe, work out what beliefs must exist in the mass
    consciousness for the occurrence of certain world events.
    Repeat this for many events, both in present time and
    through history.

    Part II; Observe a potential crisis situation developing
    somewhere in the world. Identify with the idea(s) in the
    mass conscious self that is creating that event. Define.
    Label. Disassociate. Discreate. Repeat to satisfactory
    result.

[10] HANDLING ATTACKS
(A modest plan for World Peace)



The most successful way to prevent attacks is to never be
anything, never create anything, never attempt to control
anything and always be willing to apologize. If one still finds
himself under attack, quickly create an illness or an infirmity.
The more dreadful the affliction, the safer! And if worse comes
to worse, and you should happen to be caught doing or being
anything, proclaim loudly and earnestly that it's for the good
of mankind. Spread the rumor widely that you just enjoy
selflessly helping others. And if all else fails, remember, it
is a cultural taboo to punish the insane.

While the above seems absolutely ridiculous, some observation of
the human condition will show that it is actually a rather
successful technology. In many respects it works better than
displays of force or willingness to fight, which generally has
the effect of bringing all parties to disaster.


The following four steps are offered as a much better way
of handling attacks:


    1. Recognize an attack for what it is: a result of
    _secondary originations_ manifested and projected
    onto the environment and other viewpoints of
    consciousness _by a higher level of YOUR con-
    sciousness_.

    2. Identify and Experience. Define. Label. Dis-
    associate. Discreate: (1) all feelings of blame,
    hatred, and injustice; (2) all identities that are the
    target of bad feelings; and (3) all resistance to
    peaceful settlement; until you can rise above the
    creation and identify and experience the level of
    source consciousness that is creating both attacker
    and attacked. From that level of consciousness,
    handle the attack as a persistent mass. Feel what it
    feels like. Peel off the unknowns and false
    conclusions.

    3. Create a primary from the same level of source
    consciousness to create an end of hostilities or to
    open a path of opportunity leading to an end of
    hostilities. Handle secondaries with the Creation
    Handling Procedure.

    4. Repeat steps 1-3 until you achieve your desired
    result.


Sometimes quite magical things occur when using this
handling . . . allies appear where enemies once stood!

[11] CREATION

Avatar has been a spiritual goal for many lifetimes, so it is
understandable that having achieved it, you might decide to hang
out as pure consciousness for awhile. Enjoy.

If and when you choose to return to the world and participate in
some amusements, the following may be of some use to you:


    1. The first thing to create is a goal which you believe you
can and wish to achieve.

    You might wish to create a number of goals and pick the
one(s) that excite(s) and empower(s) you when you think about it
or them. An exciting goal provides the creative energy for its
own attainment, plus a little extra. (Exhaustion is usually a
sign of a wrong goal.) A goal that empowers you will create the
energy to overcome the obstacles that lie in the way of its
attainment.


    2. You should next plan how to reduce the amount of time and
effort you feel required to spend on activities that don't
excite or empower you. (Time management.)


    3. Next, make a list of all your incomplete projects.
Determine whether to proceed or abort each project. On the
projects you decided to abort, cut your losses as much as
possible, but be willing to take any loss rather than getting
your life locked into a project that drains your creative
energy. Tailor the projects you decide to complete so that they
align with the goal that excites you.


    4. The first place you should go is a good library. Begin by
researching current methods and procedures of achieving your
chosen goal. Create a resource notebook.


    5. Now start. Use limitation and creation exercises to
smooth the way.



In achieving a goal, the last few feet are sometimes the hardest
The difference in potential between where you are and where you
are going may have dwindled. You may find that to maintain your
creative energy, the goal must move forward as you do.

All Avatars anticipate your grand achievements!

[12] ETHICS

The Key to Prosperity and Power



Codes of ethics carved in stone are the ticking time bombs
in civilizations, in religions, in governments, and in
philosophical systems.

Today's moral imperative is tomorrow's superstitious belief.

If you must carve something in stone, make it so vague as to
require interpretation by those who preserve it. This allows for
a continuing re-integration of the past, present and future.

From the point of view of the Avatar, existence is the
evolution of beliefs created by consciousness. Judgments as to
the appropriateness of the created beliefs are only _more_
beliefs created by consciousness. While this may be interpreted
as salt in the wounds of the "martyrs for a cause" and heresy by
the righteous, it is their beliefs which make it so.

Lest some "believers" draw and quarter us for being bereft
of all moral principles, let us redeem ourselves with the
following single ethical principle. You may carve it in stone if
you wish.


        A CREATION (COMMUNICATION, IDEA, PRODUCT OR
        SERVICE) IS ETHICAL TO THE DEGREE THAT IT IS
        CONSIDERED VALUABLE BY THOSE MOST DIRECTLY
        AFFECTED BY IT.


By understanding this code, and creating within its meaning,
one may create his own prosperity and power ... or determine the
cause of his lack of prosperity and power.

----------------------------------------------------------------





[13] THE ULTIMATE PROCESS

The _Ultimate Process_ is the most powerful process that I
know of at this time.


    THIS PROCESS MUST INITIALLY BE RUN BY A
    GUIDE, BUT IT IS _ALWAYS_ RUN UNDER THE
    CONTROL OF THE PERSON RECEIVING THE PROCESS.


Before running the process, the guide and the student
should agree on simple hand signals for "WAIT," for "CON-
TINUE" and for "THAT'S IT." The student, who may find he
does not with to speak, may use these signals to control the
speed and duration of the process.




THE PROCESS:


_GET YOUR IMPRESSION OF ALL THAT IS:_


    1. _Identify_ with it and experience it fully.

    2. _Define it_ by expanding your awareness to the outermost
    limits of that impression.

    3. _Label it without judgment_ just as it is.

    4. _Disassociate from_ it by recognizing: This is not-I,
    this is    my creation."

    5. _Discreate_. Turn off it's creating energy.




_GET YOUR IMPRESSION OF ALL THAT IS LEFT:_


Repeat steps 1-5 until the student signals "That's it."

Upon finishing the _Ultimate Process_, take some time alone
to relax and re-integrate.




NOTE:

The Reverse Process: (For restoration of solid states.)

    1. Get an impression of something you would like to
    experience.

    2. Ask: "What is this?"

    3. Say: "It's not mine!"

    4. Leave it alone.

----------------------------------------------------------------





A FINAL NOTE


When you are comfortably re-integrated, please sign your
checksheet and turn your notes and materials in to your Avatar
Master. If you wish, do a final write-up of your experiences on
the course.

As an Avatar your journey may now continue. The home
state--inexpressible consciousness--is sweet, indeed. Enjoy the
"amusement park" called existence, and all things in it.

Perhaps, and only perhaps, you would like to assist with the
mission of introducing the Avatar materials to the world.
Imagine what it would be like if everyone knew what you now
know and had the skills you now have.

Thank you for the gift of days you shared with us.

Until we meet again, as we must ... I send you all the love you
can imagine me sending. I do love you most dearly and welcome
you, AVATAR.
